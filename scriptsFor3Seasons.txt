 It's for you, right? It's for both of us.
 Don't go away.
 Don't worry.
 There's not enough blood left in my legs to go anywhere.
 Hey, it's Charlie.
 Do your thing when you hear the beep.
 Listen, you lousy S.
O.
B.
, I will not be treated like this.
 Either you call me, or you are gonna be very, very sorry.
 I love you, Monkey Man.
 Charlie? Who was that? Damn telemarketers.
 A telemarketer who calls you Monkey Man? I'm on some weird list.
 Okay, it's a woman I went out with once and she got a little clingy.
 You are a bad, bad boy.
 And yet, you're always the one getting spanked.
 Jeez.
 Hey, it's Charlie.
 Do your thing when you hear the beep.
 Charlie, it's Alan.
 Your brother.
 No big deal, just wanted to touch base.
 My wife threw me out, and I'm kind of losing the will to live.
 So, when you get a chance, I'd really love to I don't know Alan, I'm sorry to hear about that.
 So, where you gonna go, to a hotel? Wow.
 Well, yeah, I guess you could stay here.
 Okay.
 I'll see you when you get here.
 We better hurry.
 Is she staying over? Because I may have parked behind her.
 Twelve years, and she just throws me out.
 I mean, what was the point of our wedding vows? You know, "Till death do us part.
 " Who died? Not me.
 Not her.
 How did you get in my house? Okay, Charlie, the key in the fake rock only works if it's among other rocks.
 Not sitting on your welcome mat.
 Excuse me, but if you put the fake rock in with a bunch of other rocks, it's impossible to find when you're drunk.
 You know, I'm a good husband.
 I'm faithful.
 - Is she? - Is she what? Faithful.
 Don't be ridiculous.
 Judith doesn't even like sex.
 I mean, all she kept saying was she feels suffocated, you know? She kept going on and on, "I'm suffocating.
 " What does that mean, you know? Has a woman ever said that to you? Well, yeah.
 But not a woman who doesn't like sex.
 And Jake.
 This could just destroy Jake.
 - Jake? - My son.
 Teenagers are pretty sophisticated these days.
 He's 10.
 - Charlie, I'm going to go.
 - No.
 You two need to talk.
 I'll call you tomorrow.
 I'm sorry to hear about you and your wife.
 Come on, you leaving isn't gonna bring them back together again.
 Look, okay, this is just until things settle out.
 A couple of days max.
 She will come to her senses.
 Yeah.
 That's what women do.
 Look, you can have the guest room.
 I'll grab some sheets.
 That's okay.
 I brought my own.
 You brought your own sheets? I like my sheets.
 - Okay, then, good night.
 - No, wait.
 I mean, we hardly ever talk to each other.
 What do you want to talk about, Alan? I don't know.
 I was named Chiropractor of the Year by the San Fernando Valley Chiropractic Association.
 - Okay, then.
 Good night.
 - No.
 Charlie, what about you? What's going on with you? Well, Alan, there's not much to say.
 I make a lot of money for doing very little work.
 I sleep with beautiful women who don't ask about my feelings.
 I drive a Jag, I live at the beach, and sometimes in the middle of the day, for no reason at all, I like to make myself a big pitcher of margaritas and take a nap out on the sundeck.
 - Okay, then.
 Good night, Charlie.
 - Good night.
 Good night, Monkey Man.
 Boy, is your eye red.
 You should see it from in here.
 What are you doing here, Jake? My mom brought me.
 Will you take me swimming in the ocean? Can we talk about it after my head stops exploding? Why is your head exploding? Well, I drank a little too much wine last night.
 If it makes you feel bad, why do you drink it? Nobody likes a wiseass, Jake.
 You have to put $1 in the swear jar.
 You said "ass.
 " Tell you what, here's $20.
 That should cover me till lunch.
 Now, what I think you need to do is to make a list.
 On one side, put what you don't like about our marriage, and on the other side, what you do.
 Alan, sometimes when I think about coming home to you, I start crying in my car.
 Okay, that would probably go on the "don't" side.
 Why would I lie? The ocean is closed today.
 For God's sake, do you think you could put some pants on? Look at me, Judy.
 I could barely make it down the stairs.
 Charlie, could you and Jake Yeah, come on, kid, we'll have breakfast out on the deck.
 I already had breakfast.
 - Okay, we'll have lunch.
 - It's not lunchtime.
 That's his head exploding.
 Judith, I can change.
 Please, Alan.
 You are the most rigid, inflexible, obsessive, anal-retentive man I've ever met.
 Rigid and inflexible? Don't you think that's a little redundant? My mom and dad are splitting up.
 Yeah.
 It looks that way.
 You're lucky.
 When I was your age, I could only dream about my parents splitting up.
 - Your mom is my grandma.
 - Yep.
 Grandma says you're a bitter disappointment.
 Hey, sport, your mom wants to say goodbye.
 Listen, he doesn't know anything about what's going on, so let's just keep this to ourselves.
 Our little secret.
 Why is she saying goodbye to him? She's gonna be spending the weekend with her sister in Vegas.
 So, we decided that Jake would stay with me.
 With you? Well, with us.
 I'm hungry.
 Is this gonna be a problem? I guess not.
 Thanks.
 Listen, I've got to call my office.
 Would you mind making him lunch? - Sure.
 - Thanks.
 What are you smiling about? You don't have any food.
 Yeah, but I'm not the one who's hungry.
 Who's smiling now, shorty? - You drink milk? - Just with cereal.
 - Okay.
 - Not that milk.
 That milk.
 - What's the difference? - That's Dairy Farm.
 We drink Dairy Barn.
 Fine.
 Happy? Why would I be happy? It's just milk.
 Cute.
 Keep it up, you'll be on one of the cartons.
 Okay, cereal.
 We got Lucky Charms, Cocoa Puffs, Frosted Flakes and Maple Loops.
 I want Maple Loops.
 You know who wrote that song? - Your uncle Charlie wrote that.
 - No lie? If I was to lie, I'd say I wrote Stairway to Heaven, not the Maple Loops song.
 - You two are really good together.
 - Thank you.
 So, does your wife sing, too? - No, I'm not married.
 - What a shame.
 Wow.
 You're even better than a dog.
 Dr.
 Bloom? Yes, this is Alan Harper.
 My wife and I need to cancel our marriage counseling appointment for this afternoon.
 Yes, well, something came up.
 Well, it's kind of personal.
 I mean Well, yeah, I know the point of these things is I've got to go.
 - Hello? - Is Charlie home? No.
 I'm Charlie's brother.
 Can I help you? Hi, Charlie's brother.
 I'm Rose.
 I'm Charlie's housekeeper.
 So, you're a housekeeper? Housekeeper /actress/hand model.
 I just do this to keep the wolf from the door.
 You know what I mean? Sure.
 Come on in.
 Yeah, I can smell him.
 Smell who? Your brother.
 He has a very musky scent.
 Well, I'll just let you get to work.
 Wait.
 No.
 It's okay.
 Jake, buddy.
 Take a break.
 What took you so long? We stopped for ice cream because I'm a babe magnet.
 I got to take a squirt.
 Why do you assume he learned that from me? Because I learned it from you.
 - Hey, thanks for cleaning up.
 - No, it wasn't me.
 Rose was here.
 Rose? You let Rose into my house? She said she was your maid.
 Hell, she glued the damn cabinets shut again.
 Again? You've got somebody who comes in regularly to glue your cabinets? You've met some of the whack jobs I've gone out with.
 - It's not that big a stretch.
 - So, this is my fault? Who let her in? You're a deeply disturbed man, you know? Move it.
 Come on.
 I'm deeply disturbed? Who came here in the middle of the night with his own sheets? At least, I care what I sleep on.
 Or should I say, who I sleep on.
 Hey, pal, of the two of us, I'll bet I'm the only one who's slept with a married woman recently.
 And isn't that something to brag about? Hi, Mom.
 Do you have any idea how hurtful it is to hear about your own son's divorce on the street? What divorce? What street? How did you get in my house? You stay out of this.
 I'm here to help your brother through a very difficult time.
 How could you do this to me? Do what? Now when I want to see my grandson I am going to have to make an appointment with Judith, who, let's face it, was never very warm to me.
 And what if there's another man there? Shacking up with her? Have we even stopped to consider that? I think he's considering it now, Mom.
 - Here's your iced tea, Grandma.
 - Thank you, my little angel.
 Darling, I asked for a lemon wedge.
 All right.
 Here's what you're going to do.
 You and Jake will come live with me.
 After all, I'm just rattling around in that big house all by myself.
 That's very considerate, but as soon as Judith and I work things out, I'm going to be back at my own house.
 Sweetheart, grow up.
 Think about what I said.
 You're my son, and I'll always have room for you in my house and in my heart.
 I love you, too, Mom.
 - I love you, too, Mom.
 - Too little.
 Too late.
 - So, Vegas was good? - It was fine.
 Alan, I really want to apologize for putting you through this.
 I was wrong to blame you for my unhappiness.
 No, no need to apologize.
 What's important is that we're here and we're working on our marriage.
 You look great, by the way.
 Must be all the extra oxygen they pump into the casinos.
 - Alan - And you were right.
 I see now that the time apart did us both a lot of good.
 I know I've grown.
 I'm not that suffocating guy you threw out of the house four and a half days ago, let me tell you that.
 Jake's doing fine.
 You were concerned about him being around my brother, but Charlie's great with kids.
 All right, last card, down and dirty.
 King's bet.
 - $1.
 - I'm in.
 In.
 I'll see $1 and raise it $5.
 You raised $5 on that? - I call.
 - I call.
 Queens full of nines.
 Kid, don't you know what a full house is? Yeah.
 And I also know what a psych-out is.
 I love this boy.
 And I think we're gonna look back on this as a new beginning for our marriage.
 A rebirth.
 A renaissance, if you will.
 Alan, I think I'm gay.
 All right.
 We'll make a list.
 On one side, we'll put gay stuff I'll see you and raise you $20.
 - I think he's got you, pal.
 - He's bluffing.
 He always pulls his ear when he bluffs.
 How about it, Mighty Mouse? You in? Take him down.
 Call you.
 I hate this kid.
 What the hell is going on here? You said "hell.
 " - Throw $1 in the pot.
 - What? Hey, we all had to.
 Charlie, may I speak with you privately, please? - Whose deal is it? - Jake, go to bed! I'm out.
 What is wrong with you? Are you insane? Do you have any sense of right and wrong? Probably not.
 How was dinner? How could you put Jake in a poker game with grown men? I obviously can't be trusted.
 So, how was dinner? I leave you alone with him for a couple of hours I'm just gonna keep asking, Alan.
 Dinner was swell.
 We both had the veal piccata and she's gay! Wow.
 Most chicks won't eat veal.
 Why do I even try talking to you? Come on, I'm just trying to get you to lighten up a little.
 I don't need to lighten up.
 The world I live in is dark.
 Dark and rainy.
 And you're useless in it! Really? I wasn't useless when you needed a place to stay.
 Obviously that was a mistake.
 Are you sure? Maybe we should make a list.
 Uncle Charlie? What's going on? Can't sleep? No.
 My dad says we're moving to Grandma's tomorrow.
 Yeah, that'd keep me up.
 If it makes you feel any better, you won $80 on that last hand.
 $85.
 $80.
 The house gets a cut.
 I wish my dad was as cool as you.
 Don't sell your dad short.
 He loves you more than anything in the world.
 You know that, don't you? I guess.
 How come you don't have any kids? I don't know.
 Maybe because I love me more than anything in the world.
 - Uncle Charlie? - Yeah? I don't want to go to Grandma's.
 I'd rather stay here.
 Yeah, well, your dad knows what's best for you.
 Okay.
 Good night, Uncle Charlie.
 I love you.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 You got to love a kid like that.
 I even played him Stairway to Heaven and he still liked the Maple Loops song better.
 Charlie, I haven't seen you in two weeks.
 You finally got the house back to yourself.
 Now, do you want to talk about your nephew, or do you want to have sex? Sex.
 Definitely sex.
 - Let me ask you something.
 - Yeah? Do you ever think about having kids? Whoa, we've got a good thing going.
 Can't we just leave it at that? What are you doing? I thought we were gonna have sex.
 How am I supposed to have sex while your biological clock is going off? Hey, it's Charlie.
 Do your thing when you hear the beep.
 Hi, Monkey Man.
 I was just thinking about you and wondering why we hurt each other so much.
 Rose, it's me, Monkey Man.
 - Charlie? - Yeah, listen, let me ask you a question.
 Is there something inherently wrong with asking a woman you're involved with if she wants kids? Charlie, we got a good thing going, why do you want to mess it up? Look at you.
 All grown up and back living with Mom.
 How good do you feel about yourself right now? On a scale of one to two.
 I'm not back living with Mom.
 I'm simply staying here till Judith and I work things out.
 So, one? What do you want, Charlie? I figured you've been here a couple of weeks, you got to have blood in your stool by now.
 So, I thought if you and Jake wanted to come back to my place for a while, - that'd be okay.
 - Wait a minute.
 Are you saying you want me to come back and live with you? Well, truthfully, no.
 I want Jake to come back and live with me, but I figure you're a package deal.
 Thanks, but we're doing just fine here with Mom.
 Come on.
 We can't let Jake be exposed to her on any kind of ongoing basis.
 There's no ongoing basis.
 He's only here on weekends.
 That's too much.
 Piranhas can strip an entire cow in an hour.
 Alan, we've got to get him away from her.
 I mean, look what happened to us.
 And what happened to you? Hi, Mom.
 Charlie, you're a grown man.
 Perhaps it's time to stop blaming your mother for your own shortcomings.
 Alan, the divan is not for sitting.
 Charlie, get off the couch.
 Uncle Charlie.
 There's my good boy.
 And what did I tell you about yelling in the house? Grandma, I'm suffocating.
 Sound familiar? You're right, this madness must end.
 Here, I got you your own key.
 I am not comfortable with this.
 I mean, maybe I should go wait in the car.
 You're not waiting in the car.
 Trust me, this is a great way to meet women.
 I don't want to meet women.
 I'm still married.
 Come on, your wife's out meeting chicks, why shouldn't you? Your son is just adorable.
 - Thank you.
 - You and your life partner must be so proud.
 You're right.
 Go wait in the car.
 English   






                    			Let's see, what else? Okay.
 Here's one of the first things your uncle Charlie wrote.
 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles What do you think? Must have been before my time.
 Okay, we're done here.
 Don't put your juice box on the piano, it leaves a ring.
 How could a box leave a ring? Got to run to the grocery store.
 I'm gonna need somebody to fold these clothes.
 I don't know if the grocery store is the first place I'd go for that, but good luck.
 Remember, you're being punished.
 So, no TV, no computer, no GameBoy.
 I need you to be my eyes and ears.
 Okay, but you have to be my liver and prostate.
 Whoa, whose is this? Charlie, you want to field that one? No problem.
 Jake, sometimes when you have a casual sexual relationship All right! Jake, we take in strangers' laundry because we're poor.
 I'll be back in an hour.
 Start folding.
 No TV.
 What'd you get busted for? I painted my room at Mom's house.
 - What's wrong with that? - I'm 10 years old.
 - How about a little sock golf? - What's that? Okay, here's how it works.
 The living room is a dogleg par four.
 That means you have to get your sock into the kitchen sink - in four strokes or less.
 - Okay.
 We'll play for a quarter a hole.
 Your handicap's obvious.
 You're short, and you've never heard of the Ninja Turtles.
 All right, keep your knees bent.
 Your arm straight and swing easy.
 Oh, man, I'm being hustled.
 - We can play for less if you want.
 - Don't get cocky.
 There's 17 more holes.
 The 18th hole, all square.
 The defending champion looks to have an easy tap-in for a birdie as the gallery waits breathlessly for the rookie to respond.
 Would you please stop talking? Tempers flare as the pressure mounts.
 - Yeah.
 - It's unbelievable.
 An eagle on the 18th.
 This has never happened before in the history of sock golf! A little help here? Fans are coming out of the gallery with sacks of groceries - for the young phenom.
 - What's going on? I won.
 I beat Uncle Charlie.
 Excuse me, didn't I ask you to fold the laundry? Laundry? Are you barking mad? The child just won the coveted Palmolive Cup.
 I won.
 You lose.
 When I ask Jake to do something, I need you to help me make sure he does it.
 I'm trying to teach him responsibility.
 This sock is soaking wet.
 Yeah, I chipped into the water hazard on the ninth and the lid was open.
 - So, this is toilet water? - At least.
 All right.
 I put Jake to bed, I folded the laundry, I put the groceries away The guilt thing doesn't work on me, Alan.
 Yeah, well, it's all I got.
 I'll be back in a little while.
 - Where you going? - I have to bring the garbage cans back in.
 Today wasn't garbage day.
 - No, not here.
 At Judith's.
 - At Judith's? Alan, your wife threw you out.
 Yeah, that doesn't mean she doesn't need me.
 Yeah, it kind of does.
 Look, we're still married, it's still my house, and she still counts on me to do a few chores.
 It's good.
 It leaves the door open for, you know, reconciliation.
 I see.
 So, how do you lift those garbage cans without a spine? They're on wheels.
 What are you watching? I'm watching a movie, and you're not supposed to be watching anything.
 Oh, yeah.
 - Is that guy a good guy or a bad guy? - Good guy.
 And you're not supposed to be watching TV.
 I know.
 - Is that his girlfriend? - Ex-girlfriend.
 But he still loves her, right? I'm not going to walk you through the whole movie.
 I think so.
 - Go to bed, Jake.
 - Okay.
 Who's that guy? That's the guy he was in jail with and told him where the money was hidden.
 Right.
 - You're being punished.
 No TV.
 - I know.
 What the hell is going on? - Jake? - Goodnight.
 Hey, I'm watching that.
 What part of "no TV" didn't you understand? I'm allowed to watch TV.
 I mean Jake.
 I said, "No TV.
" He said, "Okay.
 " I said, "Go to bed.
 " He said, "Okay.
 " - What'd you want from me? - He's taking advantage of you because he knows you won't follow through.
 He obviously knows me better than you do.
 If this is gonna work out with Jake living here part-time, you have to be an adult.
 You have to impose discipline.
 Yeah, fine, whatever.
 Give me back the remote.
 No.
 You're not listening to me.
 You need to be firm.
 Okay.
 - Go to your room.
 - Yes, like that.
 I mean it.
 Give me the remote and go to your room.
 That's very funny.
 I'm serious.
 Get out of here, or I will kick your ass.
 Oh, man.
 Shoo.
 Jake.
 It was on when I came in.
 Yeah, right.
 What did I tell you about leaving juice boxes on my piano? How do you know it's mine? Come on, who else around here drinks "Transylvania Goofy Juice"? Good point.
 And another thing.
 Were you on the deck feeding the seagulls again? Sorry, I forgot.
 Okay.
 We need to talk.
 Love you, Uncle Charlie.
 Look, we don't feed the seagulls because you can't get rid of them.
 We don't leave the doors and windows open, because we get all kinds of bugs and crap flying in the house.
 - Okay.
 - No.
 Don't just say "okay.
 " This is not the grownup telling the kid what to do.
 This is just two guys agreeing how to live together.
 - Are we cool? - Yeah.
 Cool.
 - What's going on? - Nothing.
 - Was he watching TV? - No.
 Jake, I have to run a quick errand.
 Why don't you wash and dress? When I get back, we'll do something fun.
 - Can we watch TV? - Go.
 Where are you off to? The grocery store.
 - You're going to Judith's, aren't you? - No.
 Then where are you going? Judith's.
 - Alan.
 - I have to.
 The timer on the sprinkler system is broken, and the flower beds are getting flooded, and I love her and I want her back.
 Buddy, I feel for you.
 - Thank you.
 - Unfortunately, the feeling is nausea.
 Great.
 I'll see you later.
 Alan, you've been making the same mistake your whole life.
 Being the good boy, fixing everything so everybody would love you.
 It didn't work with Mom.
 It didn't work with either of the women you went out with.
 And it's not gonna work with your wife.
 You know nothing about commitment and responsibility to a relationship.
 Granted.
 But I do know when a woman's using me.
 And by that I mean not in a fun way.
 Well, you can rest easy, because no one is using me.
 And did you mean that I only dated two women including Judith? Because if you did, I have two words for you.
 Maxine Chernakoff.
 - Did you fix it? - Not quite.
 It doesn't seem like you're changing anything.
 No? Well, sometimes change happens, Judith, and you can't see it.
 Okay.
 Fine.
 When you're done fixing this, would you come and take a look at the garbage disposal? - Sure.
 - Thank you.
 Wait, no.
 What? No, I won't come inside and look at the garbage disposal.
 Why not? I know when I'm being used, Judith, and not in a fun way.
 What are you talking about? Who are we kidding? The marriage is over.
 You're just afraid to move on, so, you keep dragging me over here, and I'm afraid to move on, so I keep coming.
 Goodbye, Judith.
 You're free.
 I hope you find whatever it is you're looking for.
 - What you got there? - Just a little bread.
 Please tell me you're not feeding the seagulls again.
 Okay.
 Man, did you let another one of those big flappy bastards in the house? You have to put $1 in the swear jar, you said "bastards.
 " Smart, poke the bear.
 I'm telling you, Jake, this is the last Yikes! I'm really sorry, Uncle Charlie.
 I don't want to talk to you right now.
 Hello, do you have a department of animal control or bird abatement? I have a seagull problem.
 Seagull.
 Thank you, I'll hold.
 I didn't know there'd be so many.
 I told you, don't feed the damn things.
 I told you, don't leave the windows open.
 Yeah, hi, who's this? Phyllis Siegal.
 No, Phyllis, I wanted to talk to somebody about seagulls.
 I got a flock of seagulls in my house.
 No, I don't know whatever happened to them.
 I'm really sorry.
 We had an agreement, Jake, and you broke it.
 Look, I need somebody who can come over with a net or something.
 Sure, I'll hold.
 Hello? Who's this? Annette.
 Look, I got a room filled with seagulls and No.
 Hi, Phyllis.
 Goodbye, Phyllis.
 Good news.
 Really? Come tell me in Jake's room.
 What did he do? He didn't paint anything, did he? I want you to be surprised.
 You will never guess what happened while I was at Judith's.
 Neither will you.
 Oh, my God! So, what's your good news? Open the door! Your kid got them in there, you get them out.
 Open the door! That was not funny, Charlie.
 Depends on what side of the door you were on: Look, I'm really sorry about the birds, but I'm sure they'll leave as soon as they get hungry.
 That's what I thought about you.
 You know what? Jake and I may be out of here sooner than you think.
 - What do you mean? - At Judith's, there was kissing.
 Mutual kissing.
 Unprompted, but reciprocated by yours truly.
 Wow.
 And was it as boring as it sounds? Charlie, she kissed me.
 This wasn't the kiss of a woman who just wanted her garbage disposal unclogged.
 Well, you know her plumbing better than I do.
 You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna let her come to me.
 You know, be detached, play it cool.
 You know? Yeah.
 That's your home-run swing.
 Hey, Uncle Charlie, you want to play some sock golf? - No, thanks.
 - Where are you going? I'm going for a drive.
 - Can I come? - Nope.
 I don't think Uncle Charlie likes me anymore.
 Don't be silly.
 He's just a little upset about the 30, 40 screaming, crapping birds in his house.
 Why don't you write him a note and tell him how sorry you are? Okay.
 Don't worry, he'll come around.
 Sooner or later, everybody comes around.
 You just have to give them a little time and a little space.
 Hello, Judith? - What's in the bucket? - Chum.
 - What? - Bait.
 I went down to the bait shop and asked them what seagulls like to eat.
 We're keeping them? No.
 We're gonna throw the bait out the window to lure the birds out of the house.
 That's pretty clever.
 Yeah, it's a variation on something I do with women and tennis bracelets.
 Hey, Uncle Charlie, I made this for you.
 Thanks.
 I made it myself.
 I see that.
 - What are you doing? - I'm getting rid of the birds.
 - Can I help? - Nope.
 Jake, why don't you go out and play on the deck, okay? Okay.
 What is wrong with you? He worked really hard on that card.
 You barely looked at it.
 - What do you want from me? - He's dying for you to forgive him.
 Fine.
 I forgive him.
 Now, are you gonna help me or not? I got a serious problem here.
 Really? Because you look like you have it all together.
 Okay, here's the deal.
 We go in there and start throwing this stuff out the windows.
 When the last bird's out, we close the window and get on with our lives.
 You're ready? Sure.
 You know, if they love this bait so much, why would they even wait for It's almost like somebody tipped them off.
 - You got any other bright ideas? - Yeah.
 I'm gonna get a drywall guy in there and seal off that room.
 - Very funny.
 - I'm not kidding.
 That room is dead to me.
 Either that or sell the house.
 I'll put it on the market as a two bedroom plus aviary.
 Everybody loves an aviary.
 What about Jake? Are you gonna put him on the market or just wall him off? I tried with that kid, Alan.
 He says one thing, and then he goes and does another.
 He's 10.
 He's got the attention span of a hummingbird.
 What am I supposed to do when he ignores me? You punish him.
 You take away his computer, his TV, his toys.
 You already took away all the good stuff.
 What am I supposed to take away? His bronchial inhaler? You know what I'm saying, Charlie.
 You don't take away your love.
 Hi.
 I tried calling but I kept getting your machine, - so I thought I'd bring this over.
 - What is it? It's my master file of handymen, plumbers, electricians, maintenance schedules, warranties, authorized repair centers, et cetera.
 Okay, well, you're on your own.
 Got to run.
 Alan, wait.
 - Yes? - About that kiss? When you said we should move on, I got scared, and Alan, I kissed you out of fear.
 Hey, it still counts.
 Alan, you were right.
 We have to move on.
 Okay.
 Alan, wait.
 Yes? The garbage disposal's still making that horrible noise.
 I keep telling you not to put bones in it.
 - I didn't.
 - The sink trap does not lie, Judith.
 This is so cool, Uncle Charlie.
 Yeah, I was kind of hard on you, and I wanted to make it up.
 So, you're not still mad about the seagulls? I'm still mad.
 I just figured out a better way to deal with it.
 Well, I think this is a very good way.
 Me, too.
 I'm buying you all this stuff, but as punishment for letting seagulls in my house, you can't play with it for a month.
 A month? Pretty smart, huh? It's not fair.
 You know what this is? The world's smallest violin.
 What are you talking about? They're gone, Charlie.
 Are you sure? Check under the bed.
 All clear.
 Okay.
 I wonder why they left.
 Maybe because we stopped feeding them.
 Whoa, check it out.
 Wow.
 - You know what this means, don't you? - Yeah.
 Breakfast.

                    			If you've got bugs If you've got ants If you've got bugs and flies and slugs and things that crawl We're here! - Mom, come see my room! - I'll be right there, honey! - Hey, Uncle Charlie.
 - Hi, shorty! Hello, Charlie.
 Hi, Judith.
 What're you doing here? If you must know, I'm here to help Jake set up his room, so he feels like nothing's changed.
 Really? You don't think he'll notice his dad's living here and his mom's dating chicks? Could you say that a little louder? Jake might not have heard you.
 Just for the record, I'm not dating anyone, and I threw your brother out 'cause he was sucking the life out of me.
 Could you say that a little louder? Uncle Charlie hasn't met Porky yet! I don't suppose that's a Rubenesque 19-year-old girl.
 Porky's his pet guinea pig.
 You're bringing vermin into my house? Uncle Charlie, check him out! Isn't he awesome? Yeah.
 See those little black things? That's his poop.
 Awesome.
 I don't want him in the water this weekend.
 He might have an ear infection.
 Oh, Mom.
 No, it's okay, pal.
 We can go to Disneyland.
 We'll have a great weekend.
 We can play miniature golf, go bowling, bike riding, whatever you want.
 Alan, relax, you're starting to sound like a tampon commercial.
 Jake, why don't you go put Porky in your room? Okay.
 Alan, I'm very concerned.
 He's just a child.
 I don't know if he can deal with this.
 Give your son some credit.
 He's an incredible kid.
 I was talking about you.
 - That's fair.
 - Yeah.
 Charlie? That strange lady from down the beach is back.
 Yeah, she's here to baby-sit.
 Come again? I thought we'd go out and have a drink.
 You want me to leave my son with the whack job who's been stalking you since your one night stand? You try and find a baby-sitter on a Friday night.
 It's okay, Alan.
 Charlie and I talked and I understand that we're just friends, and that it is not okay for me to sneak into his house and lick all his silverware.
 As reassuring as that sounds, we can't go out tonight.
 We're getting up early to go to Disneyland.
 We? Yeah.
 I thought that maybe you'd want to come with us.
 Alan, I'm not thrilled about having one small rodent in my house.
 Why would I drive fifty miles to see their kingdom? I'll go! Maybe some other time, Rose.
 It turns out we're not gonna need a babysitter tonight.
 No problem.
 I'm gonna take this seat cushion, okay? Knock yourself out.
 Why does she want your seat cushion? I don't know why she brought it, I don't know why she's taking it.
 Okay, then, I'll see you later.
 Wait, you're still going out? Yeah.
 Why? I thought you wanted us to spend some time together.
 Here? Okay.
 What're you thinking? 10, 15 minutes? - Go.
 - Thanks.
 Good morning, Uncle Charlie.
 Morning, Porky.
 Did you have sweet dreams? Jake, rule number one.
 Uncle Charlie does not like to start his day with a squealing creature in his face.
 Sorry.
 Grandma's here.
 She wants you to come down.
 Okay, you're not listening.
 Rule number one This is a list of the top divorce attorneys in Los Angeles.
 I've made appointments for you with each of them.
 I don't need to meet any attorneys.
 I'm not getting a divorce.
 I'm sure you don't think so.
 The point is, if you consult with all the good lawyers, it's a conflict of interest for them to represent Judith.
 She'll be stuck with some ambulance- chasing clown from Van Nuys who will fold like an origami swan.
 I don't want this to be Mommy busted her hump on this, Alan.
 Thank you? Morning.
 Is that all you have to say for yourself? You haven't returned any of my calls this week.
 It's all I can do to not imagine you lying dead in a ditch somewhere.
 Right back at ya, Mom.
 What did you want to talk about? Too late.
 I'm not speaking to you.
 - All right.
 - Would you like to know why? No, I trust your judgment.
 Because when your brother's marriage ended, yes, I know, Alan, blah, blah, blah, and he chose to move in here, your coldness towards your mother became more than just the behavior of an ungrateful son.
 It's now an obstacle to my spending quality time with my beloved grandchild.
 Are you coming to Disneyland with us, Grandma? Darling, Grandma doesn't do Anaheim.
 We'd better hit the road.
 Try to beat the traffic.
 Thanks for dropping by, Mom.
 Let's go, Jake.
 I'll race you to the car.
 - Bye, Grandma.
 Bye, Uncle Charlie.
 - Bye.
 Wait for me, I'm going! Come on, boy.
 Heel.
 Stay.
 Now, stay.
 Who's a good dog? Oh, yeah! Hey, Jake, you want to take him? Whatever.
 Come on, leash.
 Get ready for bed.
 I'll be right in to tuck you in.
 Happiest place on earth, my snow white ass.
 I had a good time.
 Oh, really? Which part did you like best? The equatorial heat, the endless lines, or the large German woman that threw up on me in the Teacup? Maybe things could have gone smoother, but tomorrow's gonna make up for it.
 Alan, you could get us all laid tomorrow, it's not gonna make up for it.
 Hey, sleepy head.
 You're just in time.
 Your pancakes are almost ready.
 I'm not hungry.
 Not hungry? Come on, you've gotta fuel up that engine.
 - We've got a big day planned.
 - My ear hurts.
 Oh, no.
 Let me feel.
 Yeah, you're a little warm.
 Probably another ear infection.
 Okay, new plan.
 We'll get you on the antibiotics, we'll watch a little TV, play some video games.
 We'll have a great day.
 I want to go home.
 You are home.
 I know, but the real one, with Mom.
 Okay, I understand that.
 You know, when a guy's feeling sick, he needs his mom.
 Right, Charlie? Well, I may not be the one to ask.
 Okay, I'll, call your mom and, tell her we're on our way.
 All right, it's just you and me now.
 Are you really sick, or are you just fakin' it to get out of another fun-filled afternoon? I'm really sick.
 Just checking.
 Because I was gonna fake it.
 If your home is bug infested filled with spiders, flies or gnats All our sprays are safety tested we kill vermin, not your cats Hey.
 How's the jingle coming? The lyrics are fine, the music needs a little work.
 How's Jake? He'll be okay.
 I stayed over at the house a little while.
 We watched some movies, I made us some soup and a couple of sandwiches, and Judith suggested I take mine to go.
 Suggested? She started my car and threw my sandwich in the back seat.
 That's rough.
 Listen, I'm afraid I got some more bad news for you.
 No, gosh, I forgot to bring Porky back.
 See, that's the thing.
 Nothing's bringing Porky back.
 What? Porky's dead? "Buh-dee, buh-dee, buh-dee, that's all folks!" Oh, God.
 It's okay.
 We can get Jake another guinea pig.
 Jake will be fine.
 This is his fourth Porky in three years.
 He goes through them faster than shoes.
 No, this is about my life.
 Everything is going to hell.
 Okay, well, don't cry.
 We can still be friends.
 What? I'm sorry.
 It's the only thing I know to say when someone cries around here.
 I am so sorry, Porky.
 You just kept running around in your little cage, trying to make everybody happy.
 And what do you get? You get dead.
 You do know the pig can't hear you, right? Don't you get it? I am the pig! Okay.
 I'm just asking, because your reaction doesn't seem very healthy to me.
 And what do you think would be healthy, Charlie? I don't know.
 Why don't we toss Porky in the ocean and go get bombed? How could you? Okay.
 Toss him in the ocean.
 Very clever.
 Who knew pelicans eat guinea pigs? What's happening? Sunday's Tequila Night at Pavlov's.
 Every time the bell rings, you gotta take a shot.
 Why? 'Cause the bell rings.
 Okay.
 You gotta bark first.
 Charlie, when my son looked at me and told me that he wanted to go "home", that broke my heart.
 I saw.
 You know, my kid is sick, and I can't even be with him.
 You know, I'm a failure, Charlie.
 I'm a failure as a father, I'm a failure as a husband.
 You didn't fail.
 First of all, that little boy loves you.
 Second of all, just because your wife decides she doesn't like sleeping with men, doesn't mean you've failed as a husband.
 Although, I wouldn't brag about it.
 You're right.
 This is Judith's fault.
 She's the one who breached our marriage contract asunder.
 And I let her make decisions that should have been in my dominion.
 Alan, people are gonna do whatever they're gonna do in this world.
 The only thing a man can control is his own actions.
 I don't remember where we left our car.
 This isn't our car? Where to? Home.
 - And that would be? - Sherman Oaks.
 We don't live in Sherman Oaks.
 I do.
 I am a Sherman Oaksian and I am going home for as to reclaim my home.
 That's a very bad idea.
 I'll tell you what's a good idea.
 Chili cheese fries and a large root beer.
 With chili cheese fries.
 And girls.
 No.
 I am going home to my wife to impose my dominion over her.
 Yeah.
 The lesbians love that.
 Driver! Sherman Oaks! Goodbye, Charlie.
 I'll be back for my things tomorrow.
 Thank you, driver.
 You've been most kind.
 So, back to Malibu? No.
 Let's give it a second.
 Did you know they put chocolate pudding in tubes now? No, I did not.
 They do.
 My nephew eats them.
 They're surprisingly good.
 You know, that's an interesting sibling dynamic you've got goin' with your brother there.
 You get that I'm loaded, right? Drive! So? How'd it go? She chased me out of the house with a golf club.
 Taking up golf already.
 What was it like, a six iron? What difference does it make? I just want to be able to tell the story accurately.
 It's not funny.
 Then why are you laughing? Because I don't know what else to do.
 I wish I could ask Dad for advice.
 You'd go to Dad for marriage counseling? Alan, our father committed suicide to get away from our mother.
 What're you talking about? Dad didn't commit suicide.
 He died of food poisoning.
 I maintain that he knew the fish was bad, but he kept eating it anyway.
 Your mother sounds like a real piece of work.
 You have no idea, my friend.
 My mother took my baby brother and dipped him in sissy sauce and turned him into the people-pleasing control freak you see today.
 That's right! And she made him so scared of intimacy that he has just this endless stream of gorgeous girls running in and out of his life.
 Damn her.
 You know, many psychologists agree, until the core maternal relationship is resolved, most men are doomed to repeat dysfunctional childhood patterns.
 Just drive the cab, Doctor Phil.
 You know what, Charlie? He's not wrong.
 At some point, we have to stand up to her.
 Look who's got beer muscles all of a sudden.
 No, I'm serious.
 Come on.
 Right now.
 Let's confront her.
 You with me? Come on! Oh, my God.
 I can't believe it! You really are afraid of Mom! I am not.
 All these years, I thought you were so cool.
 But you're just a big clucking chicken! Ouch.
 Ouch? Okay, that's it.
 We have a new destination.
 Beverly Hills.
 You got an address? Just go east on Sunset until you reach the Gates of Hell.
 She'll buzz us in.
 I can't wait to see her face.
 She's gonna freak.
 You ready? Ring the bell.
 Who is it? It's your sons! Charlie and Alan.
 Hi, Mom.
 Dear God.
 Hold on.
 I'll be right there.
 Okay, what exactly are we gonna say to her? Now you ask? This was your safari.
 We're here to resolve the core maternal thing.
 Wait, I'll go ask the cabbie.
 Nice try.
 Somebody better be dead.
 Porky's dead.
 And you completely screwed up our lives.
 I'm sorry? - That's good enough for me.
 - Yeah, I'm good.
 Driver, drive! Good morning, sunshine.
 God.
 Close the drapes.
 Hey, what's this? "Release and indemnification form.
 " What? Were you on some kind of television show last night? I don't think so.
 You and your brother signed it.
 Let me see that.
 Alan.
 Alan, wake up.
 We got a problem.
 "Taxicab Confessions?" If you've got bugs If you've got ants If you've got bugs and flies and slugs and things that crawl Ain't that Beethoven? I don't even know how my wife is gonna be a lesbian.
 She hates oral sex.
 Hates it! English   






                    			Charlie? Honey, wake up.
 - Good morning.
 - You lied to me, Charlie.
 You said it was just going to be the two of us.
 I didn't lie, Berta.
 Things change.
 Goodbye, Charlie.
 Don't leave me, Berta.
 I love you.
 - Can't we talk about this? - Sorry.
 I do single men only.
 I'm in, I'm out, there are no complications.
 But I am single.
 Berta? I hate to bring this up again, but you just You cannot put the peanut butter in the refrigerator.
 It gets hard.
 And, on a related subject, the peanut-butter stains on Jake's shirts really require an enzyme presoak.
 I hope you two will be very happy together.
 But who's going to take care of me? Who's going to do the laundry, the shopping, - and the cleaning and all the other stuff? - Ask the Scrubbing Bubble there.
 Uncle Charlie, why is Berta leaving? Why? It doesn't matter, Jake.
 What matters is she's gone.
 And we're all going to die.
 She left before she made the coffee.
 So? We'll make our own coffee.
 How? So, now we just wait? Yes.
 It takes a couple of minutes.
 Alan, this goes beyond coffee.
 Berta's been with me forever.
 She does everything.
 She's like a wife that leaves before you wake up, and doesn't mind if you sleep around.
 Is that the coffee? It's my peanut butter.
 I made it soft.
 I've been figuring out a way to repay you for letting me and Jake stay here.
 - Why don't I take over the housework? - Berta did the shopping, too.
 - I can do that.
 - She did my laundry.
 In her way, yes.
 But I can handle that, too.
 And look, I even made your coffee.
 Thank you.
 No.
 Not as good as Berta's.
 It's her coffee.
 I just pressed the button.
 Berta's tasted, I don't know, Christmassy.
 What does that mean, "Christmassy?" It means "like Christmas.
 " Now, you got to work with me, Charlie.
 I mean, nutmeg, cinnamon, powdered reindeer? I don't know.
 It's just that when you drank it, it felt like Christmas morning, and anything was possible.
 Sweet'N Low? Half & Half? Mocha Mix? Forget it.
 I'll just read my paper.
 Where's my paper? I don't know.
 You might try looking by the front door.
 No, it's usually right here, on the table.
 Okay, so before you got up, Berta started the coffee and got you your paper? I don't know the mechanics of it, but, yeah.
 I'll go get it.
 He's not off to a very good start.
 Want a glass of peanut butter? - Alan? - Yeah? I can see you.
 And I can see you, too.
 No.
 I mean, Berta never cleaned when I was in the room.
 She was like invisible.
 I'm sorry.
 I'll try to be more transparent.
 Appreciate it.
 Oh, no.
 I see you.
 Give me a break.
 Not you.
 That girl that's been stalking me.
 Rose? There you are.
 What are you doing sneaking up on me like that? Rose, honey, we spent one night together, and it was very nice, but What is your favorite part? Gee, I'd have to say, finding out you live just two doors down.
 Sometimes, it's all I can do not to chew through that house in the middle.
 Yeah.
 But see, I'm not looking for a relationship right now.
 So, maybe you should find someone who can give you the attention you want.
 Need, deserve, require.
 Are you saying we should see other people? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.
 You have so much love to give, and somewhere out there is a guy who can take it.
 - Well, there is this one guy - He sounds perfect.
 His name is Andy.
 He works at Jamba Juice.
 He always gives me a free wheatgrass shooter and chuckles when I gag.
 Then ask him out.
 That seems kind of forward, don't you think? No, come on, women ask guys out all the time.
 What they don't do is handcuff themselves to the refrigerator, when he says it's time to go home.
 That's where you and I went off the track, isn't it? I'm the past.
 Andy's the future.
 Bye-bye now.
 Good luck, Andy.
 Alan? - What did you do to my piano? - Nothing.
 I just dusted.
 Yes, well, I'm sitting here trying to write a jingle about a chocolate bar and my piano smells like lemons.
 Gee, I'm sorry, Charlie.
 But they don't make chocolate Pledge.
 Maybe I'm not making myself clear.
 The rest of the house can smell like any fruit you want.
 But my piano needs to smell - Piano-y.
 - There you go.
 Fine.
 I'll get an unscented polish.
 That's not going to help me now, is it? Nope.
 You know what? You are a child.
 You're a big, high-maintenance child.
 I am not a child.
 Where you going? If I can't write my chocolate song, I'm going to take a nap.
 Charlie, you asleep? I'm doing a load of whites.
 Jeez! - Charlie? - What? You kicked me in your sleep.
 Who said I was asleep? I can't do this anymore.
 You are impossible.
 Don't blame me.
 I tried to make it work.
 Excuse me? Berta quit at 9:00.
 It's now 2:30.
 When did you try? Where was the trying? You're the one who made Berta quit.
 I didn't make her quit.
 I simply raised the bar of quality housework and she insisted on limboing under it.
 But since you obviously can't live without her, you big baby, I will go apologize and get her back.
 - Great.
 - So, where does she live? I don't know.
 Okay.
 What's her last name? Your entire life depends on this woman and you know nothing about her.
 Wait.
 She took a bus.
 I stand corrected.
 After she works here in the morning, she cleans some rock star's house.
 Okay, what rock star? Where? Steven Tyler from Aerosmith.
 Thank you.
 Now listen, Judith is coming by at 5:00 to pick up Jake for dinner with her parents.
 Now I should be back by then.
 But you need to make sure he's dressed and ready to go.
 - No problem.
 - No, it's a problem, Charlie.
 I'm trying desperately to reconcile with my wife, so I don't want to tick her off.
 So, you telling me, "It's no problem," does not reassure me.
 Here.
 Take my sock.
 I want to show you a trick.
 I'll go get Berta.
 You make sure Jake is ready.
 - Hi.
 - Hello.
 There are security cameras out front, so come up from the back, and bring some dog treats, in case the rottweilers are out.
 Again, thank you.
 I asked Andy out, and he said yes.
 - Andy? - That guy you told me to ask out.
 I just don't know what to wear.
 I love this one, but it still smells like pepper spray.
 Where are you going? To roll around naked on your bed.
 I'm just kidding.
 I'm going to try on the dress, silly.
 But - Is that lady your girlfriend? - No, she's just It's complicated.
 - What the hell happened to you? - You know what else is complicated? Fractions.
 You got grease all over you.
 It's in your hair, man.
 Yes.
 My bike chain broke.
 Can you fix it? Kid, I'm a piano player.
 What do you think? Look, your mom's going to be here soon to take you to dinner.
 I know.
 - So, how about a shower? - No, thank you.
 That wasn't a question.
 Sorry, pal, but you need a shower.
 But my bike's still broken.
 I think you made it worse.
 What are you talking about? Now you got a unicycle.
 Get in the shower.
 - I'm so worried he's not going to like me.
 - He's going to love you, Rose.
 Just go out, have a great time, and don't come on too strong.
 Me, too strong? What do you mean? Okay, speaking from my own experience, there's nothing wrong with asking a guy for a blood test, but trying to take the blood yourself is a little strong.
 - I see.
 - Where you going now? You got me thinking this dress comes on too strong.
 So, I'm going to put on something a little less And a little more Jake, why aren't you in the shower? Oh, yeah.
 Hi, Berta.
 It's me, the Scrubbing Bubble.
 I came to apologize.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 Bye-bye.
 Come on, can't we put aside our petty differences and find a way to work together out of a mutual love for Charlie? Yeah, that's why I do this.
 For love.
 The thing is, I'm going through a really tough time right now.
 My marriage is collapsing, my business is slow.
 My little boy is being dragged back and forth from his mother's house to Malibu.
 My alcoholic husband ran off with my daughter's parole officer, and I clean rich peoples' toilets for a living.
 Okay, let's not make this a competition.
 Jake, you've been in there for a while.
 How's it going? Good.
 What are you doing? Washing my bike chain.
 It's real dirty.
 Forget about the chain.
 You got to take a shower before your mother gets here.
 We're going to need a new chain.
 Hello, Charlie's house.
 May I help you? Hi, Alan, it's Rose.
 I got in.
 How'd you do? Here he is.
 - It's your brother.
 - Thank you.
 How's it going? Did you talk to Berta? Yes, I'm here with her now.
 - Is Jake ready? - Yes.
 We're just applying the finishing touches.
 - What about Berta? - The same.
 Finishing touches.
 She's really a delight.
 Just make sure Jake is ready when Judith gets there.
 Relax.
 Everything's under control.
 I got to go.
 - So, you like this dress better? - Hang on, Rose.
 The kid's running around the deck in his underwear.
 Sure.
 But when I do it, you just ignore me.
 - Jake, what are you doing? - Air drying.
 You still have grease in your hair.
 Didn't you wash it? You didn't say to wash my hair.
 - Wash your hair.
 - Okay.
 You didn't tell him to rinse.
 Good, that's good.
 Thank you.
 Jake, rinse! All right, so you won't come back.
 Will you at least tell me how you made the damn coffee Christmassy? Christmassy? Yeah, Charlie said your coffee tastes Christmassy.
 - Cinnamon.
 - I said cinnamon.
 Lower back? You do a lot of lifting? Of course you do.
 You're a maid, and I'm an ass.
 - I'm a housekeeper.
 - Of course.
 - And you're an ass.
 - Yes.
 Why don't you sit down, let me take a look at it? - What? - I'm a chiropractor.
 Okay.
 But no funny business.
 Not to worry.
 Looks like you washed your hair instead of mine.
 I'm not in the mood, Jake.
 These clothes look stupid.
 You're 10.
 No one cares.
 - You're choking me.
 - Trust me.
 You'll know when I'm choking you.
 I think my socks are on the wrong feet.
 Jake, dude, I'm right on the edge.
 Don't push me.
 I can't do this on someone else.
 - Charlie? - You look great, Rose.
 I don't think I can go through with this.
 What? No.
 Sure you can.
 - No, I'm going to call Andy and cancel.
 - No, you're not.
 Now listen to me.
 You're a wonderful woman.
 And this guy, Andy, is going to love you.
 Thanks, but you're saying that just to get me out of your hair.
 No, not just.
 - Now go out and have a great time.
 - But No goodbyes.
 Just turn around and walk away.
 Okay.
 Goodbye.
 Goodbye, Rose.
 - What happened? - I have to go to the bathroom.
 Why did you take your clothes off? Sometimes, I miss.
 Okay.
 That's it.
 I give up.
 You are a child, Jake.
 Dress, don't dress.
 Wash, don't wash.
 I don't care.
 You're on your own.
 What? God, that feels so good.
 Berta, I can't find my Berta, if you're going to do a guy in the laundry room, put a scarf on the doorknob or something.
 I'm a big fan.
 Is Jake ready? Where's Jake? I don't know.
 You don't know? My wife just pulled in behind me.
 - You said you'd have him ready.
 - It can't be done.
 What do you mean, it can't be done? I'm not strong enough.
 His will is greater than mine.
 I'm just going to get drunk and stay out of his way.
 Please tell me he's ready.
 My parents are driving me nuts.
 Well Hi, Mom.
 Don't you look handsome? - Uncle Charlie took my tie.
 - You don't need a tie.
 Grow up, Charlie.
 Bye.
 - I thought you said he beat you? - He did.
 Now he's just screwing with me.
 What happened with Berta? It wasn't easy, but I did it.
 She won't do my laundry, or get my groceries, and I have to give her a lower back adjustment twice a week.
 And Steven Tyler thinks I'm doing her.
 - But she is coming back? - Yes, Charlie, she is coming back.
 Right on.
 Are you crying? It's been a very emotional day.
 Here you go, buddy.
 Drink your vodka.
 You look great, Rose, I swear.
 He stood me up.
 What? After we spent all day getting ready? - I don't know what I did wrong.
 - You didn't do anything wrong.
 - Then why did he stand me up? - Because he's an idiot.
 He doesn't get what a truly rare person you are.
 Thanks.
 I wish Randy could see what you see.
 Forget about him.
 Come on, I'm going to take you to dinner.
 - Really? - Yeah, sure, why not? I thought you said his name was Andy.
 What did I say? - You said Randy.
 - No, I didn't.
 Andy's a real guy.
 I didn't make him up.
 I love your little tie.

                    			Never mix tequila and scotch.
 Morning, Uncle Charlie.
 Jake, buddy.
 Dad said you'd never get up to go to soccer with me.
 But I said, he promised.
 So he was wrong.
 What? You know, most of the parents wear shorts and lots of sunscreen, but that's another way to go.
 Alan, I can't go to a soccer game.
 I just got home from Vegas.
 You went out last night to return a video.
 I ran into a friend of mine who was getting married at the Bellagio.
 That explains the tuxedo.
 No, I think this was for something else entirely.
 I'm sure I'll read about it in the paper.
 I am the Soccer Snack Buddy this week, so I've gotta stop at the grocery store.
 Why don't you ride to the game with Jake when the van gets here? I got a better idea.
 Why don't I go upstairs, throw up and sleep in my clothes for 12 hours? Fine, but if you're not gonna come, - you gotta tell Jake yourself.
 - Fine.
 He'll understand.
 - Jake? - I got new cleats.
 Nice.
 Listen, Jake, buddy.
 Have you ever been to Vegas? So you're the infamous Uncle Charlie.
 I've heard about you.
 Everybody out.
 Watch your heads.
 One at a time.
 - Party time.
 - Come on.
 Here's the deal, Uncle Charlie.
 I find you attractive.
 I have three kids, a bastard of an ex-husband, I work 50 hours a week at my own travel agency, I'm at the peak of my sexuality, I have a three-hour window Wednesdays when the kids are at tae kwon do.
 You in or out? I'm sorry, I'm terminally hung over and I just took a cleat in the groin.
 E- mail me.
 Allaboardgloria @aol.
 com.
 So, which one's yours? Please don't make me talk.
 This is Charlie Harper.
 Alan Harper's brother.
 - So, who's winning? - No one.
 We don't keep score.
 We think it's healthier if the kids just play for fun.
 You're yanking me, right? Judith warned us that you were a pistol.
 By the way, we were so sorry to hear about her and Alan.
 So tell us, is it true? Did Judith leave your brother for another woman? - Why don't you ask Judith? - We wouldn't want to pry.
 Ladies, if you'll excuse me, I have to go because, hell, I don't need a reason.
 Someone's a little full of himself.
 Forget him.
 His brother's the one who's in play.
 How's Jake doing? Jake's fine.
 He's 10.
 He's got his whole life ahead of him.
 Me, on the other hand, I'm sitting in the hot sun, in rented pants listening to myself blink.
 I'll ask somebody else.
 What? Sorry.
 I couldn't help overhearing, and you just look so pathetic.
 Really? The guy at the tux shop said I looked dashing.
 Of course, that was yesterday.
 And I found his phone number in my pocket.
 - What was the occasion? - Just returning a video.
 - Charlie Harper.
 - Kate McLaughlin.
 Let me ask you something, Kate McLaughlin.
 What's your take on this whole no-keeping-score thing? I think it's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
 Can I stay here next to you where it's safe? Sure.
 So, which one's yours? Number nine.
 But I'm not the father.
 Aren't you a good sport? Jake, for the last time, nobody got "creamed.
 " No one won, no one lost.
 Yeah.
 Except for us.
 12-2.
 It doesn't matter if you win or lose.
 It's whether or not you beat the spread.
 Thank you, Charlie.
 Jake, go take a shower.
 Charlie, we are trying to teach the kids not to keep score.
 You should've thought of that before you taught them to count.
 By the way, what are you doing with Jake tomorrow? I don't know.
 Why? I made a play date for him with one of the kids from the game.
 You're hitting on the mother, aren't you? Can't slip one past you, can I? That's not what a play date is for.
 What? The kid plays, I have a date.
 Everybody wins.
 - Everybody wins? - Yes.
 But I promise not to keep score.
 Charlie, you cannot use my son to pick up single mothers.
 But I can.
 Good night, Snack Buddy.
 No going in the water, no throwing rocks, and remember, if you can't see us, we can't see you.
 Is there anything you'd like to add, Charlie? - Why can't they throw rocks? - Go.
 Ernie loves the beach.
 Thanks for inviting him.
 Anything for the kids.
 They're our future.
 - So, where's Alan? - I sent him to the movies.
 He deserves a break, and I get some quality uncle time with Jake.
 I think that is really nice of you.
 Ernie, keep your socks with your shoes.
 I'm sorry, where was I? You were saying I was nice about something.
 How long have you lived in Sherman Oaks? We moved in and Ernie, put that down, it's dead.
 That kid'll pick up anything, no matter what it looks like.
 Been there.
 We moved in just in time for the earthquake Ernie, I am not gonna say it again.
 Put the dead thing down.
 Jake, you should probably put your dead thing down, too.
 - Kids.
 - I know.
 They're just Ernie, put it down or we're leaving right now.
 I'm counting to three.
 One, two Ernie, for God's sake, you're killing me here.
 - Thank you.
 - No problem.
 - So, did you grow up in L.
 A? - No.
 My dad was in the Army so we moved around Hell, that thing's not dead.
 I'd like to get to know you, it's not gonna happen on a play date.
 - Ask me out sometime? - That's a really good Are you happy? I told you to put it down, Ernie.
 Get the sand off of it.
 No.
 Don't touch it.
 - What night's good for you? - Jake, you're not helping.
 - Don't wait up.
 - Back to Vegas? Even better.
 Sherman Oaks.
 The gateway to Van Nuys.
 Kate again? You have no clue what you're getting involved in - with these divorced soccer moms.
 - You're right.
 I don't have a clue.
 I've never had a clue.
 It's part of my charm.
 At least keep in mind that all these women talk to each other.
 So anything you do will get back to my wife, and somehow become my fault.
 That doesn't seem fair.
 So, where are you going? I'm helping Gloria with the soccer league newsletter.
 I'm thinking of calling it "Just For Kicks.
 " This is the same Gloria who drives the kid van? - Yeah.
 Why? - Nothing.
 Have fun.
 Talk about not having a clue.
 And I designed a logo, the "K" in "Kicks" is a little foot.
 Sounds wonderful.
 I can't thank you enough for taking the time to do this.
 Anything for the kids.
 You're such a good father.
 It's a shame that Judith didn't appreciate you.
 She just needed a little time to sort things out.
 But, yeah.
 It's a shame.
 Look at you.
 A successful chiropractor, intelligent, dedicated.
 You're embarrassing me.
 I'm sorry.
 Let's get back to your little logo.
 - What's wrong? - Nothing.
 It's my neck.
 I must have slept wrong.
 Make an appointment with my office, we'll see if we can fix that.
 No, I'd feel funny.
 We know each other.
 Don't be silly.
 It's what I do.
 Turn around.
 Go ahead.
 - Are you getting enough calcium? - I guess.
 It's really important for a woman your age.
 Osteoporosis is a real problem.
 Curvature of the spine.
 Last thing you want is to wind up with a hump.
 I hope you didn't start without me.
 - What are you talking about? - Bill, you did this on purpose.
 You showed up late so you could snoop on me.
 - You got to meet my girlfriend.
 - What meet? She was our babysitter.
 Will you get out of here, Bill? Kate, I'm trying.
 Ernie, would you put your shoes on? - Bill.
 - Charlie.
 That your Jag? - Yeah.
 - It's nice.
 I got the Navigator over there.
 That's nice, too.
 Let's go, Dad.
 All right, then.
 You try and make her happy.
 Truthfully, I think that my ex was intimidated by my sexual I don't even know, how to say it.
 Appetite.
 So we're agreed we'll set aside six inches for the editorial column? I'm sorry.
 Yes, six inches.
 I don't know how I got so off-topic.
 I know exactly how you got off-topic.
 I think the next piece of business is to decide on the paper color.
 I brought some samples.
 We've got goldenrod, salmon, mustard You had me at goldenrod.
 Everybody has you at goldenrod.
 My brother, Alan, warned me not to go out with you tonight.
 That's funny.
 Everybody warned me not to go out with you.
 It worked for Romeo and Juliet, up until the poison and the stabbing.
 Charlie, I have a confession.
 I haven't been out with a man other than my husband in 12 years.
 That's not a problem.
 A couple of things have changed, I can bring you up to date.
 Please do.
 All right, well, nowadays, women pay for dinner.
 And of course, sex is a given.
 I'll tell you one thing, I am not paying for dinner.
 Rats.
 Look at the time.
 Maybe we should get going.
 Give Gloria a chance for a little quiet time before her many, many kids come home.
 I don't need any quiet time.
 Don't be silly.
 Alan, would you mind driving me home? I'm feeling a little tipsy.
 A little tipsy? How about a little obvious? - I'm sorry? - Could I talk to you for a minute? - It is getting a little late.
 - Sit down.
 We'll be right back.
 I think she's going through the change.
 - What do you think you're doing? - What? He's in play.
 I'm playing.
 I'm the one who told you he's in play.
 Please.
 I told you two years ago that marriage was toast.
 So what? He's in my house on tae kwon do Wednesday, and I don't have time to mess around with you.
 Why don't we just let him decide? Let him decide? He still thinks we're doing a soccer newsletter.
 - You don't even like him, do you? - He's okay.
 He's here and it's Wednesday.
 I happen to think he's hot.
 You wouldn't know what to do with a hot guy.
 Yeah? Well, watch me.
 Great.
 You broke him.
 The biggest surprise was how much I loved having him around.
 I mean, Jake's amazing.
 Do you know I have, on occasion, actually put his needs ahead of my own? Like going to a soccer game at 8:00 am on a Saturday? Yes.
 At 8:00 am, I can barely get out of bed to go to the bathroom.
 What you're saying is having a child in your life totally changes the way you look at things.
 Exactly.
 Of course, you probably know that already.
 But I like that you know it.
 - I had a really great time.
 - Me, too.
 - Can we do this again? - I would love that.
 Great.
 What happened? Did I do something wrong? Please don't tell Alan's wife.
 No, you didn't do anything wrong.
 I really like you.
 Okay.
 This is new for me.
 It's just Charlie, I have a 10-year-old son.
 I have two mortgages, private school bills, a full-time job, custody battles, alimony battles, child support battles, car pools and drum lessons.
 How can we possibly do this again? You bought a 10-year-old a drum set? Don't change the subject.
 You know what I'm saying.
 Do you really want to be involved in this? I hadn't really thought that far ahead.
 Exactly.
 All right.
 I guess I'll see you around.
 Where are you going? - Home.
 - Why? I said we couldn't do it again.
 That doesn't mean we can't do it tonight.
 Boy, you really don't have a clue, do you, Charlie? No.
 But it seems to be working for me.
 Morning.
 Regular or decaf? - Regular.
 - Thank God.
 Aren't you even curious? - You went to Gloria's last night.
 - Yeah.
 I can fill in the blanks.
 We're getting killed.
 We're here for fun, right? Nobody wins or loses.
 Come on.
 Somebody always loses.
 Who are we kidding? It's 8-1 out there, and everybody here knows it.
 And you know, I'll tell you another thing.
 We haven't won a game all season.
 And I'll put that in the newsletter.
 And as God as my witness, there will be a newsletter! Dad, you're kind of freaking everybody out here.
 Forget it, Jake.
 It's Sherman Oaks.

                    			- Hi.
 - Hi, Uncle Charlie.
 How was your game? The musician's softball league is a joke.
 Guys trying to catch stuff that isn't there.
 People throwing up on an easy double play ball.
 So why do you go? There is an open bar, and they let me pitch.
 I've got to get dressed.
 I was going to throw this toast out, but it's yours if you want it.
 When did I become the family dog? - Jake, what's this, a phone message? - Yeah.
 Some lady called for you.
 Who? I can't read your writing.
 "You're a big selfish jerk.
 " Okay, I know who this is.
 Amy.
 - Probably Amy.
 - Yup, Amy.
 - She wants you to call her back.
 - Yeah, that'll happen.
 - Why not? - Because I never said I'd call her back.
 Remember this, Jake, never make promises to women that you don't intend to keep.
 - And you know how you do that? - Always keep my promises? That might work.
 A better way is never make promises.
 - What happens if Amy calls again? - Okay, I'm glad you asked that.
 When the phone rings at Uncle Charlie's house, we don't just willy-nilly pick up the receiver and answer it.
 No.
 What we do is we check the caller I.
D.
, and only pick up if we want to talk to that person.
 - Like Mom? - That depends.
 Your mom, yes.
 My mom, no.
 How come you don't want to talk to your mom? I'll tell you all about that when you are old enough to drink.
 What if I want to talk to your mom? Okay, that kind of attitude is going to break down the whole system.
 - Dad, no! Don't pick up the phone! - Why not? It might be your mom.
 Or a woman.
 It's Amy again.
 She just won't give up.
 Charlie.
 Look, I appreciate your need for privacy, but I think you're sending a bad message to my son about how to deal with women.
 How so? He thinks it's okay to avoid somebody because the conversation might be uncomfortable.
 Charlie! Okay, that's not funny.
 Look, if I am teaching the kid anything, it's honesty.
 Really? Walk me through the lesson, Charlie.
 Educate me.
 Okay.
 I tell women upfront I'm not looking for a long-term relationship.
 If they don't believe me, or they're determined to change my mind, I have a right to avoid that conversation.
 And the phone company obviously agrees with me, otherwise they wouldn't have invented caller I.
D.
 Uncle Charlie, what if somebody you don't want to talk to comes over instead of calls? - Just tell them I'm not here.
 - He's not here, Grandma! Mom, you just surprised me.
 - You should have called first.
 - Charlie, I call constantly.
 You screen like an Olympic drug tester.
 I'm happy to see you, Mom.
 I don't believe you, sweetheart.
 But at least you care enough to lie.
 I care enough to lie.
 You just caught me off guard.
 So, what are you doing here? I'm showing a house up the beach, and I thought, while I am in the neighborhood, I would drop off a gift for my grandson.
 You are writing him a check? - What kind of gift is that? - You told me he likes transformer toys.
 This check transforms into any toy he wants.
 Thanks, Grandma! Is that all? Don't I get a hug? Your grandma loves you so much.
 Grandma's got to go to work.
 Nobody just gives her checks.
 Walk me.
 In case you are at all interested, I have been seeing a man.
 And he just may be the one.
 - Five time's the charm.
 - Four.
 - But, what about the guy - That was annulled.
 Boy! Are we going to have a new daddy? Bite me, Charlie.
 I would like to have a dinner at the house so you boys can meet him.
 What night is good for you? - What night do you want us? - I asked you first.
 Jake's here weekends, it's Thursday.
 Check my calendar.
 Don't really want to.
 Tomorrow night, 7:00.
 It's very important to me, and I hope you can make it.
 But I will certainly understand if you are too busy for your mother.
 You know what she is trying to do.
 - Of course I know.
 - But maybe one of us should go.
 - Sure.
 You go, I look bad.
 - What do you care? - I don't care.
 - Then don't go.
 - I'm not going.
 - I'm not going, either.
 - I'm not staying.
 - We'll eat, we'll go.
 - No coffee, no dessert.
 - We can't be rude.
 Watch me.
 I refuse to let that woman - Hi, Mom.
 - Better late than never.
 - We're right on time.
 - I was referring to the big picture.
 Hi, Grandma.
 And look, you brought Jake to meet my new beau.
 Come here, sweetheart.
 Now, tonight you and I are going to play a game.
 And the name of the game is, "Don't call me Grandma.
 " What kind of game is that? It's a fun game, honey.
 It only has one rule.
 You have to call me Evelyn.
 - Okay.
 - Try it.
 - Evelyn.
 - See? We're having fun already.
 Look, you didn't bring wine.
 Good.
 Too many people bring wine.
 Tommy, darling, I would like you to meet my sons.
 This is Charlie.
 - Charlie.
 - Hi, Tommy.
 How are you? - Alan.
 - Hello.
 - And this is Jake.
 - Yes, I am, Evelyn.
 Let's not beat it to death, okay? Good to meet you, Jake.
 There you are.
 Boys, this is Tommy's daughter, Olivia.
 - Hello, Charlie.
 - Hi there, stranger.
 Do you two know each other? - I thought I knew him.
 - Oh, no.
 Okay.
 Who would like a drink? I would like a drink.
 Charlie, come help me make the drinks.
 Alan, talk to Olivia.
 Alan was a cesarean.
 It wasn't medically necessary.
 She just had a function to go to.
 Is there anyone in the 310 area code that you have not mounted? Come on, we went out a couple of times.
 She assumed it was an exclusive thing, and when she found out it wasn't, she got a little upset.
 Anyway, Tommy seems like a real nice guy.
 I am very happy for you.
 - Goodnight.
 - Charles.
 You are not going anywhere.
 This man is very important to me.
 We are going to have a nice dinner.
 You're going to be charming, and Tommy will remain oblivious to the fact that you defiled his daughter.
 She wasn't exactly filed when I met her.
 You don't know how lucky you are to have a mother like Evelyn.
 She is the warmest, most affectionate, giving woman I have ever known.
 That's my mom.
 Call her Evelyn.
 That's the game.
 You play your game, I'll play mine.
 - Here we are.
 - There's my little karaoke cupcake.
 Tommy, you are not telling that story.
 We took one of those little cruises to Alaska.
 Glaciers and whales, I didn't quite see the point of it all.
 But during the evening there was this karaoke competition.
 And as you know, I'm no stranger to the stage.
 Yes Mom, I know.
 Excuse me.
 Anyway, you know how I have always sung These Boots Are Made for Walking, with my little dance routine.
 Yes, Mom.
 I have it on my wedding video.
 - So, how've you been? - You know No, I don't know, Charlie.
 When people don't return your calls, it's kind of hard to know how they have been.
 Look, I know this is an awkward coincidence.
 It's no coincidence.
 When my father told me who he was dating, I made a point of being here.
 You can't argue the awkward part, right? So, I am zipping up my boots, and I am about to go onstage when this hausfrau from Tone-Deaf, Texas, gets up and starts singing my song.
 I think you can imagine how unhappy I was.
 Don't tell me to calm down.
 You lied to me.
 I did not lie to you.
 And you could have told me this on the phone.
 - You never answer your phone.
 - Of course not.
 Who wants to have this conversation? So, I sidled up to the woman and really very smoothly turned it in to a duet, when suddenly she starts pushing me.
 - You said I was very special to you.
 - You were.
 - Yeah, me and three other women.
 - I said you were special, not unique.
 Drop dead, you bastard.
 Excuse me! In my defense Screw it! Finish the story, Evelyn.
 Did you push her back? Stupid musician's league.
 I don't know why I bother.
 Get this.
 Tie score, we are down to our last out.
 Our best hitter, Billy Kresky's up.
 The bases are loaded, and so is Kresky.
 His whole family is standing behind the backstop, crying and pleading, "Go back to rehab, Daddy, we love you!" Needless to say, he choked.
 Charlie, I think we have got a bigger problem.
 - Our mother is missing.
 - Don't try to cheer me up.
 I am serious.
 I called her home, her car, her cell, nothing.
 Did you check with the captain of the flying monkeys? Charlie! She's probably just sulking because I screwed up her dinner party last week.
 That's what I thought, too.
 Except I called her office and they haven't heard from her.
 - Okay.
 That's weird.
 - Yeah.
 I think somebody needs to go over there and make sure she's okay.
 Good idea.
 You do that and I'll stay here in case she calls.
 Why don't you go and I will stay here in case she calls? No, I got to be honest, I like my idea better.
 - I'm not going there alone.
 - I'm not going at all.
 What do you want to bet she ran off to Vegas to marry this Tommy guy? If that's all this is, great.
 The only down side would be that you slept with our stepsister.
 Hadn't thought of that.
 Kinda sexy.
 - Kinda sick.
 - I'm saying.
 Look, there is no one here.
 Let's go.
 No.
 I want to take a look.
 - You have a key? - I'm the good son.
 Mom? Okay, she's not here.
 Let's go.
 Okay, she's here.
 Let's go.
 Charlie.
 Mom, are you all right? Why haven't you been answering the phone? I didn't want to burden anyone with my grief over the late Tommy Pearson.
 Tommy died? He is dead to me.
 - Okay, what happened? - He dumped me.
 Mom, I am sorry.
 The thing between me and his daughter happened years before you met the guy.
 This has nothing to do with you, Charlie.
 God, you're a narcissist.
 No, Tommy left me for some fresh-faced I am sorry, Mom.
 I know he meant a lot to you.
 Yeah.
 I'm sorry, too.
 Thank you, Alan.
 Nice try, Charlie.
 Now if you will both please leave, I'd like to be alone.
 We understand.
 Charlie, wait! We can't just leave her here.
 Fine.
 Where do you want to leave her? Mom, why don't you come back and stay at Charlie's house for a few days? - How is that? - Time out.
 Don't worry, Charlie.
 I have no desire to impose on your life.
 Appreciate it.
 All right then, chin up.
 - You sure, Mom? - Yes.
 Thank you, Alan.
 Okay.
 God! So close.
 How long is she going to sit out there? I don't know.
 I've never seen her this depressed.
 Somebody's got to go out there and show her a little love and support.
 - Jake! - Yeah.
 Why don't you go out and talk to Grandma? - Why? - Because she's a little lonely.
 - She's your mom.
 - Don't sass me.
 Go talk to Grandma.
 - Hi, Evelyn.
 - Please, sweetheart, call me Grandma.
 - But what about the game? - Games are for children, Jake.
 Uncle Charlie got me a metal detector and sometimes I find cool stuff on the beach.
 That's nice.
 But you know, that cool stuff is stuff that other people lost and will never get back.
 Trinkets and treasures buried beneath the lonely sands of time.
 - Yeah, but finders, keepers, right? - And losers, weepers.
 - He's getting killed out there.
 - It's all right, he's not crying yet.
 Somebody needs to go out there and back him up.
 $10 says it's not me.
 What's going on with you The kid's got a bladder the size of a pea.
 You were a bed wetter, if I recall.
 You know what Jake would really get a kick out of? If you could sing while Charlie played the piano.
 No, Alan.
 I couldn't.
 - Besides, Charlie always hated that.
 - Are you kidding? It was his idea.
 Pick it up, Charlie.
 We are walking, not crawling.
 "Are you ready, boots? Start walking.
 " - Okay, now.
 - One more time.
 Mom, you okay? Yeah, go back to bed, Charlie.
 No, I'm up.
 It's hard to sleep after a big show.
 Thank you for that.
 Brought back some nice memories.
 You still got some chops, Mom.
 You were rushing the tempo towards the end there.
 Sorry, I always get a little carried away when you do the James Brown medley.
 Charlie.
 Your mother's a real sad case, isn't she? You'll get over him.
 There's other guys.
 He never even called.
 Never even said goodbye.
 Maybe he was scared.
 Of what? I knew there were no promises, no strings.
 That doesn't mean there can't be common courtesy.
 To think I mean that little to him? It will be okay, Mom.
 You still got me and Alan.
 Charlie, please.
 I know how difficult things are between us.
 Maybe it's my fault.
 It's not all your fault.
 I probably haven't been the best son.
 I just want you to know that in my way, I want you to be happy and I love you.
 I guess I'll go pack.
 - Why? - I'm going home.
 - In the middle of the night? - Charlie, you just said you loved me.
 You could only screw it up from here.
 Donkey Kong! - Danke Schoen.
 - Danke Schoen.
 Danke Schoen.
 B flat.
 One, two, three.

                    			I have my own room at Mom's house, too.
 My dad doesn't.
 His stuff's in the garage.
 Do you know how to play Vampire Hunter? 'Cause I just got it.
 No, sorry.
 You got to chop off their heads.
 Otherwise they'll keep coming at you.
 Do you know where your uncle keeps the paper towels? I think there's some up there.
 Hi.
 You must be Alan.
 I'm Cindy.
 Hi.
 - Hey, Jake, it's time to get dressed.
 - Wait a minute.
 Can you get me a bowl from that top shelf? Come on, let's go.
 What happened to "Breakfast is the most important meal of the day"? Just go get dressed.
 Charlie, there is a half-naked woman in our kitchen.
 Which half? - Hey, Cindy.
 - Hey, Charlie.
 - How you doing? - Not bad.
 How about yourself? Pretty good.
 Thanks again.
 - I'll see you soon.
 - Anytime.
 Bye.
 "How you doing"? "Thanks again"? Charlie, casual sex is one thing, but this is just lazy.
 What are you talking about? I didn't have sex with her.
 She just surfs out on the Point, uses my shower and goes to work.
 So you're not sleeping with her? Jeez, Alan, I don't sleep with every buff surfer chick that uses my shower.
 What kind of guy do you think I am? I think you're the luckiest bastard to walk the face of the earth, but, that's not my point.
 I don't want women flashing their butt tattoos at my son.
 - Cindy has a tattoo? - Yes, a butterfly.
 Right cheek or left? No, wait, don't tell me.
 I want to be surprised.
 So you're not sleeping with her, but you want to.
 Yeah.
 What kind of guy do you think I am? When I moved in here, I said it was vital that we create a wholesome atmosphere for Jake.
 And you said, "I understand.
 " Alan, there's something you should know about me.
 When I say I understand, it doesn't mean I agree.
 It doesn't mean I understand.
 It doesn't even mean I'm listening.
 Then why do you say it? It seems to make people happy, and that's what I'm all about.
 That's very altruistic, but I would prefer if you'd just be straight with me.
 - Fine.
 - All I'm asking is that you keep in mind that we have an impressionable - I understand.
 - Thank you.
 - That sounds nice.
 - Thanks.
 So where are Jake and Alan today? Jake's at school and Alan's at work.
 It's just you and me.
 Tell them I said hi.
 Thanks again for the shower.
 You bet.
 You look really nice.
 Thank you.
 Bye.
 Yeah, I got work to do.
 Charlie, seeing you strike out like that just makes me love you more.
 Rose, you've got to get a hobby.
 I've got a hobby.
 - I thought we agreed we were just friends.
 - We are.
 We're friends who slept together once and then one friend never called the other friend, but luckily, the other friend forgave him.
 Where are you going? To make my friend a grilled cheese sandwich.
 Rose, I don't want a grilled cheese sandwich.
 Would you prefer a quesadilla? That sounds nice.
 But then you have to leave.
 Hey, Judith.
 Alan's at work.
 I know where Alan is.
 I came to talk to you.
 - Me? But you don't like me.
 - I don't.
 I like you.
 Jake's fourth grade class was given a simple assignment.
 Draw something interesting you see around the house.
 One child drew a record player, another drew a parrot.
 My son drew this.
 A woman's behind with a butterfly tattoo.
 On the right cheek.
 I'll have to just act surprised.
 I asked him where he saw this.
 He said, "In Uncle Charlie's kitchen.
 " You gotta admit, it beats the hell out of a parrot.
 Charlie, I am not in the mood.
 - Hold that thought.
 - I got it.
 Hello.
 Are you in for your mother? Charlie's in a meeting right now.
 But you can talk to me.
 Heck, I feel like we're practically related.
 - Is that the girl in the picture? - Rose? No.
 She doesn't have a tattoo on her butt.
 I'm guessing.
 Look, I don't care what you do in your private time, but when my son is here, I expect you to clean up your act.
 - I understand.
 - I don't like coming over here and being the bad guy, but I have to protect my son.
 I understand.
 It's hard enough going through this transition all by myself.
 Alan at least has you, I have no one.
 Except my parents, and they're completely toxic.
 I understand.
 Do you? I think I do.
 Thank you.
 That means a lot to me.
 I mean, I've always been the good daughter or the good wife.
 And you know what? Outside of those relationships, I don't know who I am.
 Am I gay, am I straight? Who the hell knows? I'm scared about this, Charlie, and I'm totally alone.
 You know what? I understand.
 Thank you for listening.
 Hey.
 I'm so sorry to take up your time with all of this.
 Hey.
 I understand.
 - Thank you, Charlie.
 - You're welcome.
 There's five minutes of my life I'll never get back.
 Don't fill up.
 Your mom's taking us out for lunch.
 Hey.
 Where have you been? I just had lunch with my mother and my stalker.
 They spent the afternoon eating off each other's plates and discussing my fear of intimacy.
 You do have that, you know.
 Anyway, look, can we talk about this picture Jake drew? What's to talk about? He's a boy.
 He saw a woman's ass.
 He liked it.
 Thank your lucky stars it wasn't the cable guy's ass, and move on.
 Hey, Dad.
 Where's Cankun? Cancn? No, it's spelled Cankun.
 It's in Mexico.
 Why? We should go there for Christmas instead of Aunt Betty's.
 - What are you reading? - Sports Illustrated.
 But it's mostly ladies in bathing suits.
 Jake.
 Come back here.
 Are you happy? I have my moments, but they're becoming further apart.
 - Jake, sit down.
 - Am I in trouble? No.
 It's perfectly natural for you to be interested in women's bodies.
 - Great.
 I'll be in my room.
 - Wait.
 Let's talk a minute here.
 I don't mind you looking at these pictures, but it's important that you know what they mean.
 I'd like to know that, too, Alan.
 Okay.
 First of all, real women don't look like this.
 These pictures have been retouched and airbrushed so that the women look like they're perfect.
 But they're really not.
 Excuse me, but I met that one, and she was perfect.
 What I'm trying to explain to Jake is that this is not what regular women look like.
 Then why don't they use regular women? Because the only way regular women can sell magazines is door-to-door.
 My point is that these women are three-dimensional human beings.
 They're not just sex objects.
 Which explains why this one's on all fours in the surf.
 - Are you quite done? - No.
 I think you're being very unfair.
 These women worked very hard, ate very little, and spent a lot of money to become sex objects.
 Those breasts alone cost $10,000.
 You can buy these? Thank you, Charlie.
 Some women choose to make their breasts larger with what's called surgical implants.
 - Why? - They think bigger is better.
 I can see that.
 What really matters, Jake, is what's inside a person.
 See, that's the lesson here.
 Do you get what I'm saying? - I think so.
 - You're sure? There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
 I mean Do you have any questions? - Just one.
 - Fire away.
 Can I have my magazine back? Congratulations, Alan.
 You've managed to take the fun out of boobs.
 Hello.
 Hi, Judith.
 Yeah, I'm so glad you called.
 I just What? She wants to talk to you.
 - Why does my wife want to talk to you? - I don't know.
 Hey, Judith.
 What's up? I understand.
 What do you understand? Not a thing.
 I understand.
 What's she saying? Hang on, Judith.
 That's my other line.
 She's upset because her parents want to take Jake to SeaWorld.
 She feels like this is crossing a boundary since they've been so unsupportive recently.
 And she's not sure if her anger is misplaced.
 Since when are you her new best friend? I don't know.
 Something's gone horribly wrong.
 Sorry, you were saying? I understand.
 You're the coolest.
 Love, Cindy.
 Are you sure your nephew's gonna like this? Who says it's for my nephew? - You're really cute.
 - Good.
 I'm sorry there's no waves.
 Yeah, I don't know how I'm gonna get my exercise today.
 It's a puzzler.
 Why don't you open up another bottle of wine - and we'll figure something out.
 - Okay.
 I'm sorry to just drop by, but I had to talk to somebody.
 I just left Jake with my parents so they could take him to San Diego, and I got in this terrible argument with my father.
 He thinks it's my fault that Alan and I are breaking up, and he knows exactly how to push my buttons.
 The question is why do I need his approval? Why do I need approval from any man? I understand.
 Charlie, how could you possibly understand? I'm sorry.
 I didn't realize you had company.
 No, we were just hanging out.
 I'm Cindy.
 - Hi.
 Judith.
 - Hi.
 I've spent the better part of my life trying to win my father's approval.
 - You, too? - Yeah, I almost married a guy - just 'cause my father liked him.
 - I married a guy just like my father.
 - Disaster, right? - It's his brother.
 I met him.
 He's pretty tightly wound.
 - He is.
 - Yeah.
 - Do you want some wine? - I want a lot of wine.
 Yeah.
 You know it's so funny about relationships and men.
 - You just wonder all the time.
 - Always.
 I do not understand.
 Morning, neighbor.
 - Charlie's not up yet, Rose.
 - Oh, Alan, don't you think I know that? I brought a Frisbee for your son.
 It's a Glow-in-the-Dark Pro model.
 - There are teeth marks in it.
 - They're not mine.
 Actually, Jake's in San Diego with his mom's parents.
 Boy, that hardly seems fair.
 Evelyn never gets any quality time with him.
 - Evelyn? - Your mom.
 I know her name.
 But do you know how much she loves you, and would appreciate a call once in a while? Hi, Alan.
 Shower open? - Yeah.
 Help yourself.
 - Hi, Alan.
 Judith? What are you doing here? Cindy's teaching me to surf.
 She says I'm a natural.
 'Cause she's got the upper body strength for it.
 Nothing like yours.
 You will.
 You just gotta build up your lats.
 Wow! They're so firm.
 Come on.
 I'll show you some exercises before we hit the shower.
 So, when's Charlie getting up? In about nine seconds.
 Wake up! What? I was having a great dream.
 Your girlfriend and my wife.
 Surfing.
 Showering.
 Rubber suits.
 Okay.
 This might be better.
 Charlie, you've got to do something.
 - You're right.
 - Yeah.
 Charlie, what are you gonna do? What do you think? I just woke up.
 Come on.
 They could be lathering each other up right now! Alan, you're not helping this go any faster.
 I can't believe this is going on under my own roof.
 Well, under your roof.
 God knows what's going on under my roof.
 - You know, there is good news here.
 - Really? What's that? Now we know why I never got anywhere with Cindy.
 Hello? Me? Okay, listen.
 What do we really know here? Your wife has taken up surfing.
 We're good so far, right? She made a new friend.
 Still good? Yeah, I guess.
 Do we know for a fact that they're showering together? - No.
 - Okay.
 So what do we know for sure about Cindy and Judith? Cindy's not interested in you, and Judith thinks she's gay.
 There you go.
 And I got to see penguins and a manta ray.
 And I got to pet a shark.
 And the coolest thing was the whales.
 They splashed everybody.
 You could see right through this one lady's shirt.
 And I think maybe she had plants.
 Implants.
 Yeah.
 Implants.
 I asked Grandma if she had them, and Grandpa said, "I wish.
 " And then she got mad at him and then they bought me ice cream.
 So you had a good trip? Yeah.
 When I got home, I went to the movies with Mom and Cindy.
 Wait.
 You, Mom and Cindy? There you go.
 - She's gonna teach me to surf.
 - Of course she is.
 She's not gonna be happy until the whole damn family surfs.
 Why don't we give her Aunt Betty's number? Squeeze that fat ass into a wet suit.
 Here, Jake.
 Take your pizza and go watch TV in your room.
 Dad said "fat ass.
 " You've seen Aunt Betty.
 It's not swearing if it's true.
 Now go.
 She gets all bent out of shape when Cindy is prancing around here with her butterfly butt sticking out.
 But all of a sudden it's okay, 'cause the butt is on the other foot.
 Alan, chill out, buddy.
 No! This is the worst kind of hypocrisy and it will not stand.
 Forgive me, Alan, but that self-righteous attitude is a big part of what drove Judith away in the first place.
 What? Where did you get Where? Did she tell you that? Hey, girlfriends tell each other everything.
 Don't look at me like that.
 Listen, if she really is gay, then there's nothing you can do about it.
 Except maybe try and figure out why a lesbian married you in the first place.
 But if she's just experimenting and you act all loving and supportive, then maybe she comes back to the home team.
 Or maybe I could find it in my heart to actually be loving and supportive.
 Sure, if you want to reinvent the wheel.
 Hey.
 You know, I would've been more than happy to drop Jake to your house.
 No problem.
 This worked out great.
 I've been surfing all day with Cindy and we just had a bite to eat.
 Isn't that nice.
 Listen, are you in a hurry? Because there's something I wanted to talk to you about.
 No, I guess not.
 What's up? I just wanted to let you know that I'm okay with this.
 More than okay.
 I understand, love and respect you for your courage to explore things.
 Thank you.
 I'm really starting to enjoy it.
 And I support that.
 Yeah, I've only done it on my knees so far, but Cindy says I'm almost ready to try it standing up.
 You know what? I don't need to hear the details.
 The more important thing is that I accept you and Cindy as lovers.
 And more power to you, sister.
 You pompous, assuming bastard.
 You think I'm sleeping with her? No.
 I just got out of a 12-year marriage and you think I would jump into bed with someone I just met? Man or woman? - No.
 - You should be ashamed of yourself.
 - I am.
 - Two women become friends, and you jump to the conclusion they're having sex! Where do you get that kind of sleazy thinking? The jogger.
 The one on the left.
 Real? Good eye.
 With the sports bra, that could have gone either way.
 Of course, if they do go either way, they're usually fake.
 Jake, honey, get your stuff, we're going home.
 - Okay.
 See you, Uncle Charlie.
 - See you, buddy.
 Hey, girlfriend.
 Don't "girlfriend" me, you shallow piece of crap.
 Fake.
 Real.
 Jake.
 Who does she think she's kidding with those things? Jake, I swear, if you don't stop it, I'm taking you home.
 I understand.
 English   






                    			This is where I sit.
 Right on.
 Good location.
 What else? That's the sink.
 If you put your thumb over the hole, you can squirt water all the way over to the other side of the room.
 Cool.
 I'm not allowed to use the sink anymore.
 Got it.
 - So, what's the deal with your teacher? - Miss Tuttle? She's very strict.
 That could work.
 Did you see this drawing our son made? It's a cry for his parents to get back together.
 Alan, it's Davy Crockett at the Alamo.
 I know.
 Breaks your heart, doesn't it? I can see you got your brother here.
 Yeah, he wasn't thrilled about it, but he can't say no to Jake.
 And I kind of implied that Miss Tuttle was a bit of a freak.
 Excuse me? You wanted me to get him here.
 He's here.
 The rest is up to you.
 So, come on.
 You gonna introduce me? - What for? - She's your teacher.
 You're my nephew.
 I feel like Come on, just do it.
 Don't you want to see my model of a California mission? - It's made of sugar cubes.
 - Okay.
 First your mission, then mine.
 May I have everyone's attention? Hello.
 I'm Judith Harper, the class mom.
 I just want to thank you all for coming.
 This is a great turnout.
 Give yourselves a hand.
 I understand you teachers are sadly underpaid.
 That's very true.
 I'd like to do my part.
 Can I buy you dinner? So please feel free to put your name on the sign-up sheets if you're available for carpools, coaching, fieldtrips.
 Charlie Harper.
 Jake's uncle, mentor, pal.
 And finally, and this is a biggie, folks.
 It looks as if we're gonna have to cancel our annual music show for our fourth graders.
 Unless someone with music experience volunteers to help us out.
 Anyone? Anyone at all? - Charlie? - Yeah.
 Thank you.
 Charlie Harper, everyone.
 What? Go ahead, say it.
 You traitorous, rat bastard.
 Good.
 You feel better? You set me up.
 You lured me into that classroom with promises of donuts and loose women.
 I'm sorry.
 I honestly thought there'd be donuts.
 What about Miss Tuttle? The freak? She's a married Christian missionary! Okay, that I just lied about.
 But it was for a good cause.
 The kids really need you.
 Yeah, but see, here's the problem.
 I don't like kids.
 - You like Jake.
 - Jake's different.
 He's cool.
 He's our kid.
 The rest of them.
 - What other kids do you know? - I see them.
 Having tantrums in supermarkets, screaming in movie theaters, making everything sticky.
 And the whole world gives them a free ride just because they're cute.
 Okay.
 Forget about the kids.
 Do this for me and Judith.
 Not really a big Judith fan, either.
 Come on.
 You'll write the music and lyrics.
 Judith and I will produce and direct.
 Together.
 Hold on.
 So you roped me into this because you think that the three of us collaborating on a fourth-grade tribute to the Industrial Revolution will somehow lead to you getting back together with your allegedly gay ex-wife? It's easy to make anything sound stupid, Charlie.
 Look, we're still legally married.
 Frankly, I don't buy the whole gay thing.
 A gay woman would not fake orgasms for 12 years just to protect my feelings.
 Okay.
 Take off your seat belt.
 - Why? - Because when I slam on the brakes, I want to watch you go through the windshield.
 Don't be silly.
 Do you know how fast you'd have to be going to Hey, slow down.
 Manpower, horsepower, coal and steam Moving forward the American dream Electric, atomic, solar, too All this energy for me and you - I want to like it.
 - Yeah, want to like it.
 - But? - But I just don't think it's your best work.
 It's not.
 Fire me, please.
 Do you remember that show that you and I did in college? Stormy Weather? Sure.
 - Now, those songs had a point of view.
 - Yeah.
 And you couldn't get them out of your head.
 Co-ed bathrooms, co-ed bathrooms Wear your flip-flops in the co-ed bathrooms Stuff grows on the floor there And whoops! There's another pubic hair See? Maybe the easiest way to do this is for us to write the actual song.
 Yeah.
 Then Charlie could just toss in the specific notes and stuff.
 Yeah, Charlie, what do you think? Okay, then I guess it's just the two of us.
 - Like the old days.
 - Yeah.
 Except this time I'm not a virgin.
 How come you're not helping Mom and Dad with the show? How can I put this? Your uncle Charlie is a professional musician, and your mom and dad Suck? Good a word as any.
 I think they're gonna get back together.
 - You do? - Yep.
 Except if my Dad moves back to Mom's house, I probably wouldn't see you anymore.
 Of course you'd see me.
 You'd still have your room here, and I'd come visit.
 - You never visited before.
 - That's 'cause I didn't know you before.
 That's 'cause you never visited.
 Gin.
 To tell you the truth, Jake, I don't think this is gonna be an issue.
 You don't think they're gonna get back together? - I didn't say that.
 - Do you? - Hey, what do I know? - I think they are.
 Robert Fulton, Eli Whitney Robert Fulton, Eli Whitney All aboard for Henry Ford Henry Ford And then Careful what you wish for, pal.
 Charlie, we're gonna be late for rehearsal.
 - What are you doing? - Making margaritas.
 But we've got a rehearsal at Jake's school.
 Don't worry, I have a plan.
 Charlie, you're taking liquor to Jake's school? You betcha.
 I'm not gonna face all those pre-pubers without a snootful.
 They'll have limes in the teacher's lounge, right? No.
 There's no limes, there's no swizzle sticks, there's - Oh, God.
 - What? It's from Judith's lawyers.
 Really? Good news? No, it's not good news.
 Judith filed for divorce.
 Man.
 I'm sorry.
 What am I gonna do? There's a lot of ways to respond to something like this.
 Anger, grief, denial.
 What would you do? I'd probably blow off rehearsal and start chugging from the blender.
 But I wouldn't recommend that for an amateur.
 I can't believe she blind-sided me like this.
 Being so nice and friendly to my face.
 Meanwhile her lawyers were working behind my face.
 Let me tell you something, Charlie.
 A woman who would do such a thing cannot be trusted.
 Yeah, well, maybe you can use this divorce as a chance to take a little break from each other.
 No, that would be playing right into her hands.
 Alan, your kid's confused enough about you and his mother.
 Don't make it worse.
 How could I possibly make it any worse? Let's find out.
 Okay, everybody, what we're gonna do is put the girls on one side - and the boys on the other.
 - Sure.
 Start splitting them up early.
 That's your answer for everything, isn't it? Excuse me? Would Mrs.
 Plaintiff please see Mr.
 Respondent in the hallway? Watch the kids, we'll be right back.
 Wait! Jake? Where's Jake? Okay.
 Everybody take five.
 That means sit down.
 Stand up.
 Hop up and down.
 Right on.
 But why file for divorce? We were getting along so well.
 We've been getting along because I don't feel trapped, suffocated and depressed anymore.
 Sure, kick me out, then work on improving yourself.
 Okay.
 Everybody flap your arms like a chicken.
 Alan, check it out.
 I got this amazing power.
 Stop.
 It's like having my own robot army.
 No, wait, where are you going? - Are we gonna do our songs? - Hey, I'm just the piano player.
 Lerner and Lowe are out in the hallway working things out.
 - Who? - Lerner and Lowe? My Fair Lady? Camelot? Aren't there any gay kids here? - They're fighting again, aren't they? - Yeah, what can I tell you.
 Your Mom lawyered up and your Dad is freaking out.
 Stay cool, I'll try to get them back in here.
 Hey, everybody, Jake's in charge.
 So, whatever he says.
 Okay, it's been fun.
 But I'm officially resigning as the Mayor of Booger Town.
 Not now, Charlie.
 You know, I have tried everything I can to make you happy.
 I don't want to rush you or anything, but have you ever read Lord of the Flies? But you know what? You know what? I'm through.
 Maybe your lawyers can make you happy.
 Your brother's a horse's ass.
 Hey, let's not lose sight of who the real victim of this divorce is.
 Me! Okay, I think we should all calm down just a little.
 You're not our teacher.
 Why should we listen to you? Okay, let me put it another way.
 Shut up and sit down! Thanks.
 Now, listen, rehearsal's over.
 You can all go home.
 What about our play? You know how they say, "The show must go on"? They weren't talking about this show.
 - Your uncle's so lame.
 - Is not.
 He's cool.
 - Yeah, right.
 - He is.
 He's almost famous.
 He wrote the Maple Loops song.
 - Did not.
 - Did, too! - Prove it.
 - You see that Jaguar in the parking lot? Maple Loops.
 That doesn't prove anything.
 Fine.
 It's got oats and corns and wheat It's the sweetest breakfast treat It's maple-licious - Everybody knows that? - Of course.
 It's the Maple Loops song.
 - Uncle Charlie, do Fudge Nuggets.
 - Yeah! Fudge Nuggets! From the magic chocolate mountain In a secret chocolate mine Come granny's big fudge nuggets With a taste that's oh so fine What do you know.
 Maybe I don't hate kids.
 Hi.
 I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads up about the divorce papers.
 I'm sorry if I overreacted.
 Just the girls.
 - What's going on in there? - I don't know.
 Smell like a man Stick, pump or can With Dry Guy Deodorant Only the girls get sweaty We're getting there.
 Okay, thank you, Charlie.
 Yeah, we'll take it from here, okay? Too late.
 You're out.
 What about the songs we wrote? Hey, kids, what do you think about the songs they wrote? They're bad.
 These are my people.
 What do your jingles have to do with the Industrial Revolution? Look, you wanted a show, I'm giving you a show.
 Now step back and let us work.
 Plumber in a Jar.
 Let's really sell it this time.
 When your sink backs up there's just one star It's the one you trust It's Plumber in a Jar Plumber in a Jar Hey, what you doing? I'm trying to find some plausible connection between my jingles and the Industrial Revolution.
 - What's up? - I just talked to my dad.
 He said that he and Mom aren't getting back together again.
 Yeah.
 - How you doing with that? - I'm not sure.
 I like that I get to stay here on weekends.
 That's cool.
 I like that, too.
 But you gotta be sad about your folks, though, right? No, I'm okay.
 Jake, it's okay to feel sad, I've been told.
 - And this is a sad thing.
 - My dad's not sad.
 Of course he is.
 He's just trying to protect you.
 - From what? - From being sad.
 Yeah, I know it's a vicious circle.
 But the liquor industry is built on it.
 - What? - It's not important.
 All you need to know is that we all feel sad sometimes and it's okay.
 - Understand? - Yeah.
 Hey, buddy.
 It's okay, Dad.
 Before the Industrial Revolution, we lived in an agrarian society.
 Most people grew their own food and ate what they grew.
 Breakfast involved slaughtering animals and milking cows.
 It would be hundreds of years before people could enjoy a pre-packaged and nutritious breakfast.
 And what's in that breakfast? It's got oats and corns and wheat It's the sweetest breakfast treat It's maple-licious As urbanization led to stress and loneliness, industrial society looked to an ancient agrarian product for a delicious and refreshing solution.
 The girls look prettier with Hammerstein beer You like what you see and you like what you hear Have a cold frosty mug and pull her near The girls look prettier The girls look prettier with Hammerstein beer We're not letting him anywhere near the Christmas pageant.
 Agreed.
 Even with the advent of indoor plumbing, the Industrial Revolution still had some bugs in the system.
 What was man to do? Three, four If your home is bug infested Filled with spiders, flies, and gnats All our sprays are safety tested We kill vermin, not your cats English   






                    			- Charlie.
 - Come on.
 That tickles! - Uncle Charlie? - Not now, Jake.
 I just heard the Fudge Nuggets song you wrote on TV.
 Great.
 Great.
 - Jake, I'm not alone in here.
 - No way.
 Way.
 - Who's in there? - A friend of mine.
 - Is it a girl? - Hold on.
 Oh, yeah.
 Is it Janet? No.
 It's my friend Wendy.
 Say hi to Jake, Wendy.
 Hi, Jake.
 You sing really well.
 I have to go.
 This is embarrassing.
 - I like that you didn't lie to him.
 - I try to be honest.
 It's a good quality.
 So, who's Janet? You want a cup of coffee before you go? No, you've got work to do.
 I should probably get going.
 Charlie, there's French toast left.
 No, thanks.
 You met Wendy, right? Sure.
 French toast, Wendy? No, thank you.
 I should really get going.
 You know, I can sing all of Uncle Charlie's jingles.
 No kidding? You're gonna have to show me sometime.
 - That's wonderful.
 - Wendy's gotta go, Jake.
 Jake! Take five, buddy.
 Copasetic.
 That means okay.
 When he moved in here, he was saying "swell.
 " Charlie, I've gotta go to my office for a couple of hours.
 - Are you okay to watch Jake? - No problem.
 Swell.
 Will you take me Rollerblading, Uncle Charlie? - I can't, buddy.
 I got work to do.
 - What am I gonna do all day? It's really nice outside.
 Why don't you wash my car? No, I wanna go Rollerblading.
 I could take him.
 I've got my blades right in the car.
 - Really? - Lf it's okay with your father.
 - That sounds swell.
 - I'll go get my blades.
 And if you want, I can go pick up lunch and bring it back and we can have a picnic.
 Yeah.
 Swell.
 Nice girl.
 Is it serious? It is now, you dumb-ass.
 Finish your jingle? How can I work? First, Wendy took Jake Rollerblading.
 Then she took him to the movies.
 Now she's in the kitchen, making us all dinner.
 That bitch.
 Don't you get it? She's using your kid to turn a nice, casual relationship into a relationship.
 Okay, now I get where you're coming from.
 - Thank you.
 - You're paranoid and you're nuts.
 Perfect timing.
 Dinner's ready.
 Did you see that? She's wearing an apron.
 In my house! Do you know what that means? I'm gonna stick with paranoid and nuts, Bob.
 Are you sure that you don't want me to stay and do the dishes? Positive.
 Alan would just re-wash them anyways.
 - I guess I should probably get going.
 - Yeah, I guess.
 Good, you're still here.
 Jake wants to say good night.
 Wow, he's such a sweetie.
 Don't you just want to eat him up? If that would stop him, yes.
 I gotta tell you, Charlie.
 I think that girl's a keeper.
 - You think so? - Yeah, she's smart, she's pretty, and I think she really likes you.
 Be honest, Alan.
 You married the first girl who slipped you the tongue, didn't you? - No.
 - Trust me, this woman has a plan.
 And it's diabolical in its Machiavellian scope.
 I did not marry the first girl who slipped me the tongue.
 I'm telling you, she's got her foot in the door and she will never leave.
 Okay, I'm out of here.
 Diabolical! - Okay.
 So, I'll give you a call? - Yeah.
 That'd be great.
 Okay.
 It's pretty dark out.
 Maybe you should go in the morning.
 Yeah, I guess I could.
 Are you seeing this? Howdy, neighbor.
 Charlie's busy right now, Rose.
 I know.
 White Toyota hasn't budged an inch two nights in a row.
 I chalked her tires.
 You do know there's a stairway right over there? Of course.
 Did you know there's a crawl space under the house that comes right up into your bedroom? - So, what are you doing? - I'm playing computer Scrabble.
 All by yourself? That's so sad.
 I used to play with my wife every night, and I guess I miss it.
 You and I have a lot in common, don't we? How so? We're both like two lonely socks that want desperately to keep someone's feet warm.
 But we don't match up with any other socks.
 So all we can hope for is to be a dust mitten, or a hand puppet.
 That's very insightful.
 And disturbing.
 You're not thinking you and me, are you? That's very flattering, but Wendy? "Dear Charlie, thanks for a wonderful night.
 "Sweet.
 Special.
 See you soon.
 " Freedom! I'm free, I'm so free All right, you had sex last night.
 You don't have to turn into Mr.
 Bojangles.
 It's better than that.
 I had sex and I woke up alone.
 If there were pancakes on my night table, it would be the perfect morning.
 What happened to Wendy's diabolical, Machiavellian scheme to never leave? I don't know.
 I must have foiled it somehow.
 Guess what? Grandma's here! Let's see that little dance again.
 When I was pregnant with Charlie, we thought he was gonna be a girl.
 The sonogram showed no discernible penis whatsoever.
 Now do you believe me? First she sucks in Jake, then you, now Mom.
 She's like one of those pods from outer space.
 But, you know, with a cute ass.
 She wouldn't even be here now if you hadn't taken her upstairs last night.
 That was not my fault.
 You saw how she kissed me.
 I had to take her upstairs.
 And remember what I said.
 Hook him on the milk, he'll buy the cow.
 Charlie, where have you been hiding this girl? She's an absolute delight! Yeah, she's swell.
 - Good morning, Charlie.
 - Good morning.
 I read somewhere you had left.
 I was on my way out the door, and then I ran into your mom, and then we started talking, and, you know.
 Yeah, I know.
 So what brings you here, Mom? - Do I need a reason? - I'd like one.
 I'm showing a house in Malibu.
 I thought I'd swing by and take my grandson out for pancakes.
 Charlie wants his on his night table.
 I'm ready.
 You coming, Dad? Are you kidding? I want to hear more about that sonogram.
 Good.
 Are you and Wendy joining us, Charlie? Gee, Mom, I think Wendy has stuff to do.
 Right, Wendy? I can always make time for pancakes.
 Wonderful.
 A family breakfast.
 Go put on some pants, Charlie.
 - But, Mom, I - Now.
 You have to be firm with him.
 By the way, your nose is adorable.
 - Thank you.
 - I'm guessing Dr.
 Shapiro? No, it's mine.
 Sometimes God does good work, too.
 Jake, get your stuff together, we gotta get you back to your mom's.
 Already? But we're playing.
 Yeah, I gotta get going, too, Jake.
 Okay.
 I pulled your car around.
 If you leave now, I think you'll miss all the weekend traffic.
 Don't you worry, Charlie, I'm leaving.
 I'm not worried.
 I just moved your car so Alan can get out.
 I can get out.
 Yes, Alan.
 Now you can.
 Thank you for a great weekend.
 No, thank you.
 - Jake, bye.
 - Bye.
 - Alan, I'll see you soon.
 - Bye.
 I gotta tell you, Charlie, I think she's really Okay.
 What? I'm just saying, I think she's really great.
 Me, too.
 When's she coming back? Let's see.
 Today's Sunday, so Never.
 Why not? Buddy, she wants something different in a relationship than your uncle Charlie does.
 - What does she want? - Uncle Charlie.
 - What do you want? - Uncle Charlie.
 And we both can't have me.
 - I don't understand.
 - It's very simple, buddy.
 Uncle Charlie is nuts.
 Yeah, nuts like a fox.
 So then Wendy can't take me Rollerblading anymore? - Nope.
 - No more movies? Afraid not.
 Boy, you suck.
 Suck? How do I suck? Like a fox.
 There he is! Let the party begin! Shaking Jake! Notorious J-A-K-E! Jake, he won't stop until you say hello.
 Jakety-Jake-Jake! Hello.
 How was school this week? We missed you around here.
 - It was just school.
 - Yeah, I heard that.
 "Just school.
 " Right on.
 I don't believe it.
 He's still mad about the Wendy thing.
 Charlie, it's only been a week.
 I'm still mad that you peed in my Boy Scout canteen in 1978.
 Not much of a jamboree for you, was it? Okay, I'm sorry about the canteen.
 Now will you please make your son like me again? How would I do that, Charlie? And by the way, was that so hard? Explain to him that Wendy was working an angle, making friends with him to get to me.
 Do you really want me to tell a 10-year-old boy that somebody he cares about was pretending to like him? What kind of lesson is that? He lives in LA.
 He might as well learn now.
 Just give him some time.
 He'll get over it.
 - Can I come in? - It's your house.
 - Well, it's your house, too.
 - Then, no.
 Okay.
 You know what? It is my house.
 Look, I'm sorry about the Wendy thing, but there's nothing I can do about it.
 And I want us to be buddies again.
 I don't want you to hate me anymore.
 - I don't hate you.
 - Good.
 I'm just very disappointed in you.
 I get enough of that crap from my mother.
 So what's it gonna take? Cash? Video games? I don't want stuff.
 I got plenty of stuff when my mom and dad broke up.
 Dude, this isn't the same thing.
 What's the difference? You liked Wendy, then you didn't like her, and no one cares what I want.
 Jake, buddy.
 Come here.
 Come here.
 Sit down.
 It's not that I don't care what you want.
 It's just that you're a kid.
 And what you want doesn't matter.
 Wow, I do suck.
 H- A-T.
 Hat.
 That's it? All this time for "hat"? Let me see your tiles.
 See.
 You had "hateful.
 " See, it would have fit right here, off the "A" in my "quotidian.
 " Wow, how did you see that? I have Scrabble eyes.
 It's a gift.
 And sometimes a curse.
 Alan, Jake won't play with me.
 Well, I can't play with you either, Charlie.
 I am "occupied.
 " You played "pie" at your own peril, my friend.
 - Hi, Charlie.
 - Hi, Rose.
 Alan, come here.
 Your move.
 What? - What are you doing with Rose? - I'm teaching her to play Scrabble.
 - Alan, you are so naive! - "Naive," eight points.
 What? Sorry.
 I'm in my game head.
 Alan, Rose is using you to get to me.
 Do you hear the rampant egotism, "rampant," 11 points, "egotism," 10, coming out of your mouth? - I'm just saying - Not everybody is trying to get to you.
 The only thing that's going on here is two lonely people playing a game of Scrabble.
 Please tell me you're not thinking about you and Rose? Me and Rose? Let's see.
 One Russian blonde.
 One Scottish brunette.
 And a full-bodied redhead from Napa Valley.
 Charlie's angels.
 - Sorry.
 Oh, hi.
 - Hi.
 - What are you doing here? - I'm grocery shopping.
 Here? In my supermarket? So this is just a coincidence? Well, it's not entirely.
 I eat food, and I live two blocks away.
 Come on, Wendy.
 We both know that - Everything okay? - Yeah, everything's fine.
 Dave, this is Charlie.
 Charlie, Dave.
 Dave, we need a Duraflame log.
 Okay.
 - Who's that? Your brother? - No, he's Look, Charlie, I know I probably should've given you a call, but I thought that after last weekend, it was pretty clear, it wasn't gonna work out between you and me.
 What? I was happy to entertain your nephew for a while.
 I mean, he's a great kid, but who's got the energy? And your mother, she's been calling me all week.
 She wants to go to a spinning class with me.
 What is up with that? I thought you two hit it off.
 I'm from the Midwest.
 I was being polite.
 What did you think was going on? That.
 - So, no hard feelings? - No, of course not.
 So you and Dave, how serious is that? Goodbye, Charlie.
 You know, you're breaking a little boy's heart.
 You see, my relationships with women, they come and go.
 But you and me, we're family.
 That's solid.
 That's forever.
 You with me? I think so.
 Maybe I shouldn't be laying this on you, because you're 10.
 But I'm beginning to realize I might not be the guy I thought everybody thought I was.
 Yeah, it's a mind blower, isn't it? You see, the problem isn't with who I go out with.
 The problem is with me.
 Your Uncle Charlie has major trust issues with women.
 And I think it might have something to do with my relationship with my mom.
 I understand.
 Do you? No, I'm just tired and I don't care anymore.
 So, we're cool? - Yeah.
 - Good.
 - Good night.
 - Good night.
 - Uncle Charlie? - Yeah.
 Does this mean you don't have nuts like a fox? Yeah.
 That's what it means.
 Don't look at my tiles, Alan.
 Scrabble eyes, my sweet patootie.
 He's a tile peeker.
 Rose, listen.
 I think I owe you an apology.
 You mean for seducing me with your roguish charms and then dumping me like a bag of old doorknobs? That, and more recently I told Alan that you were being nice to him just to get close to me.
 And I've come to realize that's my own paranoia about women trying to manipulate me.
 And I'm sorry that I projected that on you.
 Come here, you big silly.
 - I forgive you.
 - Really? Thank you.
 Okay.
 I gotta go.
 Your brother is out of control with that egg timer.
 You think maybe I could play with you guys? It's fine with me.
 Go ask Mr.
 That's-not-a-word.
 Thanks.
 And again, I'm sorry.
 I'll be right there.
 Phase 1, complete.

                    			- Hey, what are you doing? - Picking out a shirt. That one looks nice. - You like it? - Yeah. Then, no. Okay. Listen, I was wondering, do you have any plans for Thanksgiving? - Alan, I don't think that far ahead. - It's this Thursday. No kidding. Didn't we just get through that whole pumpkin, the costume thing with the kid? - Halloween? - Yeah. Three weeks ago. - No, I got no plans. Why? - I was thinking, Jake's gonna be with his mom and her parents, and I thought, maybe you and I could do something. Okay, want to go to Vegas? I was thinking something a little more traditional. Reno? - Charlie, it's a family holiday. - Yeah, so, I'm your family. Unless you want to spend a perfectly good Thursday with "Mom, The Impaler. " - Think we can get into the Bellagio? - Leave it to me. That one's nice. Here's what we'll do. We'll fly to Vegas, have a big steak dinner, get you a lap dance and a bucket of nickels. - What are the nickels for? - I'll explain it on the plane. That sounds kind of fun. Two single guys, rocking out in Vegas, - the glitz, the glamour - Dude, don't gay it up. You know, I like this shirt much better. Stop screwing with me, Alan. So, who's the lucky gal? - Remember Lisa? - Lisa-who-used-to-live-here, Lisa? She lived here, she moved out, she lived here, I moved out. At one point, neither one of us lived here. Yeah, that Lisa. Wow. So, she's gonna take you back again? Hey, who said she's the one who broke up with Yeah, I'm hoping. - Good luck. - Thanks. I've completely lost confidence in this shirt. - Hey, Lees! Sorry I'm late. - Hey. How many times did you change your shirt before you left the house? - I wanted to look pretty for you. - You're such a girl. Thanks, you, too. - It's good to see you. - It's good to see you, too. So, you want to just blow this place and get a room? - I can't. - Why not? I'm getting married. Yeah. Ha, ha. Me, too. - I'm not kidding. - You can't do that, you love me. That's not the point. I'm tired of doing this dance of death with you. Hooking up, breaking up, making up. That's not a dance of death. That's the circle of life. It may be your life, but it's not mine. Not anymore. - I'm moving on. - To what? To settling down, to having a family, to not having my heart constantly broken by a man who refuses to grow up. And that would be me? Yes, you, you big ass. But the sex was awesome though, right? Yes, it was. But there's more to relationships - Is it awesome with your fianc? - None of your business. It's not, is it? God, why did I call you? I'll tell you why. Because in your heart, you know you're about to make a huge mistake and you want me to talk you out of it. No, I was hoping you and I could have some closure. Then I refer you back to my suggestion that we blow this place and get a room. Same old Charlie. What if I wasn't? Would you still be marrying this clown? Bo is not a clown. - Bo? - Bo. I'm sorry, Bo-Bo is a clown. Charlie, you'll never change. Look at you, a grown man who can't even commit to long pants. Hey, I can commit to long pants. I was just focused on the shirt today. And for your information, I've gone through changes like you wouldn't believe since the last time we were together. - Like what? - Well, I have a kid now. God, Charlie, what poor girl did you knock up? No. It's my nephew. He and my brother are living with me now. - I'm like, Mr. Family Guy. - Yeah, right, "Family Guy. " How's it going with your mom? What the hell's my mom got to do with family? Come on, Charlie, we both know you'll never have a successful relationship with any woman, let alone me, until you resolve your issues with your mother. Well, as a matter of fact, it just so happens on that note, since you mentioned it, - those issues are resolved. - Really. How'd that happen? You know, communication, self-reflection, personal growth, crap like that. The important thing is, I now have a much deeper appreciation for what do you call them, traditional values. "Traditional values?" This from a guy who offered my sister a car if she'd come to bed with us? It was a joke, and I was drunk. But still, it shows a yearning for family. - Okay, this is going nowhere. - Lisa, wait. I'm sorry. I don't want you to not be in my life anymore. I'd like us to be friends. - I'd like that, too. - Good. - So when are you getting married? - We haven't set a date. We're gonna talk about it when Bo gets back from New York on Monday. - So, you're all alone for Thanksgiving? - Yeah, why? Change of plans. What's so tough to understand? We're gonna have a big family dinner right here. And whose big family were you planning on inviting? You know, you, me, Jake, Mom, turkey, just like the good old days. What good old days? It's just an expression, don't get hung up on it. - Oh, and Lisa might come. - Okay, what's going on? - I need to show Lisa that I'm a family guy. - But you're not. That's not the point. She's about to go off and marry some jerk just because he loves her and wants to settle down. I get it, you're Satan. Alan, this is serious. I could lose her forever. Wow, and you care? I love her, Alan. She's the only one I ever thought I might eventually wind up with. "Eventually wind up with. " I'm touched. So you want to, what, keep her warming up in your bullpen until the bottom of the ninth when you lose your arm? Okay, I don't know how we got onto sports, but the thing is, I really care for Lisa and she needs to believe I'm capable of changing. But the thing is, you're not. You don't know that. I might be. Who knows what would happen if I actually tried. You're really serious about this. Alan, I've got a 200-pound turkey melting in my lap. - What do you think? - Okay, how can I help? Obviously, we can't have a family Thanksgiving without a kid. So you need to get Jake back from your wife. Simple as that? Okay, so I go to Judith and I say, "Forget the fact that we agreed on a custody schedule, "forget that your parents are driving all the way from Sacramento "to spend time with their grandson. Charlie needs to use our son as a prop "so he that can maintain an on-again-off-again relationship "with a woman with whom he might eventually wind up. " - You know what, I'll talk to her. - Yeah. No way in hell. Are you insane? What's wrong with you? Okay, maybe I didn't explain it correctly. You explained it fine. You're not taking Jake for Thanksgiving. Not just Jake. You can come, too, and your parents. Think of it, the whole family, just like the good old days. What good old days? Why is everybody so damn literal? Judith, what is Thanksgiving about, if not family? Wouldn't it be good for Jake to spend Thanksgiving with his whole family, because that's what Thanksgiving is about, family and stuff. - I don't know. - You wouldn't have to lift a finger. I'll have someone there to do the cooking, the serving, and the cleaning. - Really? Who? - My housekeeper, Berta. She's a saint, and she's really looking forward to this. No way in hell. Are you insane? What's wrong with you? - Come on. - I don't work holidays, Charlie. - Please. - I've got a life, you know. Pretty, please. My brother is in the Witness Protection Program, and I've been invited to spend Thanksgiving with him at an undisclosed location. - I'll give you $1,000. - Done. - Hi, you must be Jake. - Yes, I am. My wonderful Uncle Charlie has opened his home to me and my father 'cause we had nowhere else to go. Hey, Merry Thanksgiving. I like what you've done with the place. You picked out everything here. I know. Just wanted to make sure you did. Charlie, I've got to admit, I never thought I'd see the day when you'd be hosting a family Thanksgiving. Like I've been telling you, I've changed. So, with that in mind, you wanna blow this place and get a room? - Charlie, stop it. Come on, introduce me. - Fine. Lisa, this is Judith, my former sister-in-law, - but still, you know, family. - Hi. - It's nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. And these, of course, are her wonderful parents, - Sherman and Lorraine. - Sheldon and Lenore. Sheldon and Lenore. It's great to see you, folks. - So, Shelley, how you liking California? - We live in California. So you must really like it. - Hi, Lisa. So nice to see you again. - Hi, Alan, long time. See, isn't this great? This is why we all come together. We break up, we make up, but in the end, the love is the love and the family is the family. Ease up on the wine, Charlie. No, he's right, and Alan, Sheldon and I want you to know that even though you and our daughter are no longer married, we will always think of you as our son. What the hell's that supposed to mean, Ma? It means that, even though you loused up your marriage, we still love him. Thanks a lot, Dad. I appreciate the blame. This is really Judith's family. Let's go find mine. - Hey, Berta. Look who's here. - Hi, Berta. Honey, don't tell me you're back here again. Don't you ever learn? As a matter of fact, I think I have. Good for you. You can do so much better. And remember, you may have two grandmothers, but only one of them has enough money to send you to medical school. What if I don't want to go to medical school? Then you'd break your grandmommy's heart - just like your father did. - Dad's a doctor. No, sweetheart. Your father's a chiropractor. That's a masseuse without the hot oil. - Go play with your friends. - I'm the only kid here. You might want to think about why that is. I want more money. Hey, Mom. You remember Lisa, right? We used to live together. No, I don't. I'm sorry. Hello, dear. My son has had so many little roommates. I just hope you've got better taste than the one who picked out his hideous furniture. Hey, who's got unresolved issues with her now? Did it ever occur to you that you might want to support me, - your daughter? - Why can't we support Alan, too? - Because I'm divorcing him. - Who told you to go and do that? It's very sweet of you to go to all this trouble, but who are you kidding? The plaid shirt, the sweater vest, the kid actor. No, that's really my nephew. I love you, Charlie, but you're not gonna change my mind. - Live with me. - Charlie. - No, I'm serious. Move back in. - Really? And then what? And then, we'll see. Wow, a commitment to "see. " And what finger does that ring go on, Charlie? - You know what I mean. - I know exactly what you mean. You want me to waste a couple of more years of my life on a relationship that's absolutely doomed to fail. Not your life, our life. Look, I appreciate your feelings for me, but I have to tell you, I really think your daughter deserves a lot of respect. It takes real courage to make changes in your life and not worry - about what everybody thinks. - Thank you, Alan. That's true. The lesbians of my generation were too scared to come out of the closet. Does that mean what I think it means? - You haven't told them? - No. I thought it would be more appropriate coming from your mother. I'm sorry, did I faux pas? - Yes, just get her out of here. - Mom What was I thinking? Happy Thanksgiving. Sorry I'm late, but I didn't realize you're having a party. - Hi, I'm Rose. - Hi. Don't worry. Charlie and I had sex once, but now we're just friends. Who's ready for mystery pie? If you were living here, these kinds of things probably wouldn't happen. Here it is. Berta, nice looking bird, thanks for blowing off your family and cooking for ours. Shove over. Are we gonna go around the table and say what we're thankful for? Me, I got one. I'm thankful for the food we eat, and thankful for the friends we meet. I'm thankful for my comfy seat. I'm thankful for the birdie's feet. White with foam, God bless America - Pull up, Rose. - Sorry. - Jake, why don't you go? - Okay. I'm thankful for my mom and dad, and my Uncle Charlie, "who has shown in the few short months that I've been here "that he is capable of " Significant. " significant change and growth. " - Too obvious? - Little bit. Okay, well, I'm thankful that I can spend the holiday with all the people I love, and all the people who love me, and Judith. I'm thankful I'll be dead someday and you'll all feel horrible you weren't nicer to me. And I'm thankful that our daughter gave us at least one grandchild before she I'm thankful I finally found a therapist who has no compunction about prescribing powerful sedatives. I'm thankful I can sit here and listen to you rich people whine while my family's scrabbling for a corn dog at the Pomona Fairgrounds. - Charlie? - No, you first. I'm thankful for you, and I hope you'll always be my friend. Okay, well, I'm thankful for you, too. And I'm thankful for everybody coming together today as unwitting participants in my desperate charade. Amen. Okay, maybe I should carve the turkey. I'll handle that for you, Son. - No, you both sit down. I'll do it. - No, Mom, I can do it. No, don't be ridiculous. - No, I insist. I would love to. - I appreciate the hospitality. Okay, everybody, stop! Mom, give me the knife. Charlie, don't be silly. You don't know how to carve a turkey. Maybe not, but I'm the head of this household, and the head of the household is supposed to carve the turkey. Why, because you saw it on some TV show? - I swear, you are just like your father. - No, I am not just not like my father. My father was afraid of you, and I'm not anymore: Okay, there was one unresolved issue. Charlie, now you're being foolish. Give me the knife and sit down. Back off, lady. Every Thanksgiving, you took the knife away from Dad, and when you did that, you took away his manhood. You're not gonna take it away from me. There, see, it's carved. It's carved with my manhood. I don't think I'm very hungry anymore. Lisa, marry me. - Marry you? You want me to marry you? - Yes, you know, eventually. You sure you don't want some turkey for the road? No, I'm fine. So, are you gonna invite me to your wedding? Charlie. Will you at least call me when you get divorced? You'll be first on my list. - For what it's worth, I do love you. - I know that. - Best of luck. - Thank you. You look good in long pants. Thanks. Charlie, we're still eating.

                    			Okay, after I get the tickets, you line up for the popcorn, while I go nail down some good seats. I want butter in the middle. Don't just let them squirt it on the top. And a large cherry slurpy. Then you hold the seats while I go to the men's room, and then I'll do the same for you. That way we can enjoy our drinks during the movie without fear. Got you. - You're not gonna do any of that, are you? - Nope. So you want to go in there with no coordination, - no strategy, just winging it? - That's what I'm thinking. I have no faith in this at all. Now for her, I'd stand in line for a butter squirt. Yeah, she is a hottie. Hey, that's no hottie. That's your ex-wife. - Judith? - Alan. Sorry about the squirt thing. Wow, look at you. New hair, clothes. You look Wow. - Thank you. - No, thank you. It's a public service when a gay chick goes lipstick instead of lumberjack. So, how was the movie? Where's Jake? Home with the babysitter. Alan, I'm kind of on a date. Okay, is that her? Hi, nice to meet you. I'm the ex. Alan, that's not my date. - Hey, Alan. - Phil? What a coincidence. Phil is Jake's soccer coach. Phil, you remember Judith. Well, yeah One-Mississippi - Alan? - What? two-Mississippi. Oh, God. Okay, we're all caught up. Wait, you're dating Phil? How can you be dating Phil? Alan, he asked me out. What about the whole gay thing? Did you even give that a chance? Phil, we'd better go. Hey, look, Alan, I hope this doesn't affect our friendship. - No. Call me, we'll hang out. - Great. Hey, how's Tuesday? Tuesday's good. Judith, how's Tuesday for you? Just walk away. I know you built your sundeck without a permit and I am calling it in. Alan, chill. That two-faced, wife-poaching, soccer-coaching, rat-bastard! Come on, let it go. - I'll treat you to a cherry slurpy. - I don't want a cherry slurpy. Are you sure? 'Cause I think Phil's gonna get one. What does she think she's doing? She's straight, she's gay, she's straight again. Place your bets. Where she lands, nobody knows. Alan, it's no big deal. Women get to experiment with their sexuality. It's only guys who have to make a choice and stick to it. - Where do you get this stuff? - I make it up. Anyway, it doesn't matter what Judith is. - It only matters what she's not. - And what is she not? She is not coming back to you, pal. Thank you for your sensitivity. All I'm saying is, is that Judith has moved on with her life, and maybe it's time for you to do the same. I know. It's just I can't. - Sure you can. I'll help you. - How? I don't know, by saying things like, "Sure you can. I'll help you. " Great, thanks. Look, this isn't just about you, you know? All this wallowing in the past is causing other people to suffer. - You mean Jake. - I mean me. You are really starting to piss me off. Okay, that's enough help for now. I'm saying maybe it's time to stop feeling sorry for yourself. - You're right, I know you're right. - Forget Judith. There's a whole world out there that you haven't pissed off yet. There is no reason I couldn't find happiness with someone else. There you go. This could be the beginning of the rest of my life. A bit of a bumper sticker, but sure, why not? In fact, for the first time since college, I can go after any woman I want. Heck, I could take a page from your book - and date them two, three at a time. - Yeah, right. I mean, yeah, right. You know what? I'm gonna start right now. I am gonna die alone. No. You just don't know how to sell yourself. Give me a minute. - So? - Lf it was up to them, you'd die alone. - Great. - Okay, here's the thing. If you want to play in this league, you have to make a few changes. - Like what? - Hang on. - Pretty much everything. - Everything? Yep. The hair, the clothes, the fuddy-duddy personality. What do they know about my personality? Okay, that part's mine. Face it, Alan, you've been an old fart since you were 14. What is that supposed to mean? It means, how many eighth-graders carry a briefcase and a pocket watch? That was the Esperanto Club look. Unless you know where all the hot Esperanto chicks hang out, you're gonna need to shake things up a little. Really? And how to do I go about "shaking things up"? Hang on. This may take a while. Don't wait up. Hey, guess what? Coach Phil made me first-string on the soccer team. - Is that so? - Yeah, it's weird, 'cause I suck. Maybe Coach Phil sees some potential. - So, what else is new? - Mom's got new clothes and new hair. It's like she's a different person or something. - But she's still the same person, Jake. - No, not really. She walks around the house singing all the time. - She just sings for no reason? - I guess. I wonder if it's the same reason I sing for no reason. Does Coach Phil sing for no reason? For God's sake, Charlie! How come you haven't changed anything yet, Dad? - Why should I change? - So you'd look cool like Mom. - You don't think I look cool now? - No. You know what, it doesn't matter if I look cool, we judge a person by what's inside them, not by what they wear. Lucky for you. Yeah, lucky. - I'm done. Can I go watch TV? - Sure. Help me, Charlie. I want to sing for no reason. Get your jacket. It's time to go. I don't want to go. I hate clothes shopping. - You can't stay here alone. - Why not? You know why not. But you don't have a turtle to put in the microwave anymore. - Get your jacket. - Fine. I'll put on my stupid jacket, we'll get in the stupid car, and we'll go stupid clothes shopping. Hey, don't talk to your stupid father like that. - So, you ready for your big makeover? - You know what? Actually, I am. - I was up all night thinking about it. - All night? Maybe your money's better spent on a hooker. No, listen, I was in the bathroom, looking at myself in the mirror, when I noticed, and I think I can be completely objective about this, that I have a very nice ass for a guy my age. And I think I should start dressing in such a way as to play that card. You know, for the ladies. Go ahead, check it out. Am I lying? - Hi, Mom. - Good, you remember me. - Hello, Charlie. - Hey, Mom, right? Very cute. I was in the neighborhood, I thought I'd stop by. I'm sorry, Mom. We were just leaving. It never fails, does it? Whenever I would like to spend some quality time with my grandson there's always something more important going on. It's not fair, you know. I'm not getting clothes, so why do I have to go and be bored? You don't, you can stay here with Grandma. - What? - What? - Have fun. - Wait, no, I'll be good, I swear. Payback's a bitch, buddy. - This department looks nice. - You're sure? Because this is the top floor. There's no more clothes above this floor. - No, I have a good feeling about this floor. - Great. - How about this shirt? - No, I don't think so. Okay. - How about this? - No. Good. - This one? - No. - This? - No. Tell you what, why don't you pick something? - I thought you were gonna help me? - Pick something. Okay, flying solo. This is something I could see myself wearing. - You like this? - Yeah. Let me see that. Please, if she has one more facelift, she'll be wearing her ass as a hat. Jake, honey, turn the TV down, Grandmommy's on the telephone. I'm sorry, what? No, I'm just spending a little quality time with my grandson. He's an amazing boy. We're very close, two peas in a pod. What? Hold on. Jake, how old are you? - Ten. - Seven. I said, "Ten. " If I'm 55, you're seven. He's an adorable boy, and he just loves me so much. Jake, tell my friend, Cheryl, how much you love Grandmommy. Go on, darling. I'm 10. How's it going in there? Whatever happened to zippers? I miss zippers. I don't know, Alan. Maybe there were too many injuries. Nobody ever got their balls caught in a buttonhole. - Come on out, let's see. - I'm just not sure about this. We're never gonna find the right look for you unless we experiment. Now, let's see. I'm not happy with visible nipples. Yeah, that's what is wrong with it. That's it. We need a gay guy. His name is Sponge Bob Square Pants, and his friend's name is Patrick. He's a starfish, and he lives on the same street Sponge Bob, and he's unbelievably dumb. Squidward lives there, too. Of course, he's a squid and he hates Sponge Bob, and he plays the clarinet. Both Squidward and Sponge Bob work at the Crusty Krab for Mr. Krab, who's really cheap, but Sponge Bob doesn't care because he just likes being a fry cook and making Krabby So, bottom line, he's a sponge? Yeah. His pants are square 'cause he's square and so is his underwear. They're tighty-whities, but they're square. - Oh, dear God. - He has a pet snail named Gary, that Okay, relax the shoulders, good. The style suits you, the pants hang beautifully. Oh, dear. What? You're not gonna be wearing those shoes, are you? - Say no. - No. Could you show us some shoes that will go with this? I'm sorry, I don't actually work here. I came in for a belt. Okay, we got an outfit. Let's go find some shoes. No, Charlie, I'm done. I can't do this anymore. Don't worry. I'm sure there'll be a gay guy in the shoe department. No, I've changed my mind. I don't want new clothes. What? You look great. That guy said you looked stunning. He said "fabulous," but that's not the point. - This is not who I am. - Yeah. But who you are couldn't get laid underwater with a tank full of oxygen. - Forget it, let's just go home. - Wait a second. I spend all day schlepping from store to store with you, listening to you whine, and now that we finally found - something that works, you want to bail? - I don't feel comfortable in this stuff. - I knew it. I knew you'd chicken out. - Chicken out? I'm not even gonna dignify that with a response. At least your wife had the guts to try something new. Don't go there, Charlie. I mean, the soccer coach was kind of a sideways move, - but you gotta admire the effort. - Fine. I will buy the stupid clothes, but I'm never ever - going to do this with you again. - Promise? I just hope he's worth all the drama. Hello. Mom, Jake? In here. Hello. - Hey, Dad. - Hi, Alan. - Rose, what are you doing here? - Babysitting. - Where's my mother? - She left. - Why? - I don't know. We were watching Sponge Bob Square Pants, and she stood up and said, "Life was too short. " Luckily, I happened to be out on the deck, not doing anything, just passing by, and she asked me to baby-sit. - Dad, you look cool. - Really? You think? Yeah, very sexy. So where is Charlie? He dropped me off. We had a little disagreement. Was it about those dorky shoes? - Hi. - Hi. - Mind if I join you? - Might as well. You're gonna have to drive me home. I just wanted to say that I know you were just trying to help, and I appreciate it. Thanks. I just got a little panicky. Change is not easy for me, Charlie. Really? I hadn't noticed. And I'm not just talking about the clothes. The clothes are only the tip of the iceberg. Only the tip of the iceberg. Leanne, I'm gonna need another shot. - Continue. - Yeah, it's like, I was married a long time, Charlie. It's who I was, it was my identity, "Married Guy," "Husband Man," "Captain Dependable," and I had a uniform. And, I don't know, I guess, I just didn't want to take it off. 'Cause you'd lose your powers of dependability? - So, Charlie, who's your friend? - My brother, Alan. Hi, Alan. I'm Leanne. It's nice to meet you. I've actually met you a bunch of times. No, I'd remember you. I come in here with Charlie all the time, I always order a rum and Diet Coke? Right. So, Alan, the usual? No, today let's try something different. - Charlie, what are you having? - Tequila shooters with a beer back. Great. I will have a rum and Diet Coke. You've got it, hon. Was she flirting with me? I think she was flirting with me. I think there was definitely a connection. Alan, you do understand she works for tips? - Rum and Diet Coke, please? - Here. - Did you see that? - What do you expect? You bought a sport jacket, not a magic lamp. Hello. I didn't see you back there. Oh, yeah. I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille. English   





                    			Well, Judith, you can't have it both ways. No, if you want to stay in that house, and drive that car, then I have to live here to save money. No. I don't agree that he's a bad influence on Jake. Uncle Charlie, I understand the point spread, but I'm still confused about the vig. Okay. Vig is short for vigorish, and it means the percentage you pay - to a bookie to take your bet. - So it's better to be a bookie. My little boy is growing up. Judith, hang on. I have got to stop you here, because right at this very minute, I am watching Charlie help Jake with math. Well, go ahead and call your lawyers, but I think I am well within my rights here. Well, I don't know what Jake is telling you about Charlie's dates, but he is a kid, and he blows things out of proportion. Well, if by nude swimming you mean, she had no bathing suit on whatsoever, then that never happened. I can see the clothes hamper was a wise purchase. - Berta? - No, it's Liz Hurley, but I'm holding water. I'm still sleeping here. Could you come back in a little while? I could, or you could get your pampered ass out of bed and let me do my demeaning job and get on with my hellish life. Excuse me, Berta, but last time I checked, you work for me. So I'll get up when I'm good and ready. Sorry I had to pull rank on you. - Berta, for God's sake! - Hey, do you want clean towels? - But I'm trying to do something here. - So do it. Well, I can't do it now. Is something wrong? I mean, beyond the usual demeaning-job hellish-life stuff? Do you really want to know? No, but I'm up and my bed's gone. Okay. So I told you about my daughter, right? - You have a daughter? - I have three. Three? Wow. You gotta start learning to say no, little lady. Hey, Berta. Morning. Now, you know I hate to criticize, but the coffee filters you've been buying have chemicals in them. And I love it! Get out of my way. - What's wrong with her? - Apparently she has children. And one of them showed up last night and left her little girl, who I have to drag with me everywhere because I can't leave her alone in the house. - So you brought her here? - Yeah. Is that gonna be a problem? - No. - That's wonderful. - Happy to have her. - Yeah. - So where is she? - She's playing with Jake. Good. A little playmate for Jake. That'll give him something to do for today. I hope they're quiet 'cause I got a lot of work to do. Nana, did you throw out my cigarettes again? - Dear God! - Oh, hell! Prudence, you're 16 years old. You want to end up on a breathing machine like your Uncle Chick? - Mom lets me smoke. - Well, why didn't you say so? No reason I shouldn't trust the judgment of a woman who's off selling bootleg Metallica t-shirts at a monster truck rally. Mom sounds like a real go-getter. So what am I supposed to do here all day? You're supposed to help me clean, that's what. Here. You can start with his toilet. Hi. - I'm Alan. - Hi, Alan. What kind of car do you drive? - A Volvo station wagon. - What do you got? I got nothing. Not a damn thing. Hey, Prudence, I set up my Xbox. You ready to play? - Sure. - Get to work, Prudence! Maybe later, handsome. Stupid old woman. Isn't she wonderful? - Dear God. - Oh, hell. Well, I'd better get started on that work I have to do. Yeah, I gotta catch up on some paperwork that has to do with the office. - Oh, yeah. Your job. - Yeah. Your chiropractor job. Yeah and you'll be, what, you'll be writing a jingle? Yeah. Potato chips. You know, the The ones in the can. Yeah. I like those. All right, then. - I'm gonna go over to the piano now. - Yeah, and I'm gonna go to the kitchen and Yeah. Hey, you play piano? Yes. You're pretty good. Thanks. - Are you in a band? - No. I used to go out with a bass player. He wrote this beautiful song for me, called Dear Prudence. Yeah, that sounds like something a bass player would do. You know, I've always wanted to play the piano. Do you think you could teach me something? Nope, nothing, not a damn thing. So, do you have a girlfriend? Me? Oh, yeah. Big-time girlfriend. We're practically engaged. Prudence, he's old enough to be your father. And knowing your mother, he might be. - Just wash the damn windows. - I'm not your father. How do you stand her? She's such a bitch. Don't talk like that about your grandmother. Hey, you don't know her. She's all sweet and nice with you. Yeah. She's a real gumdrop. My point is, you've gotta respect her because she loves you and I've seen her pick up the stove to vacuum under it. Oh, hey, look! There's Rose, my girlfriend. Come on in, baby. Okay. Rose, this is Berta's 16-year-old granddaughter, Prudence. Prudence, this is my girlfriend, who I'm free to take across state lines, Rose. - Wow, look at that kiss! - What? Oh, thank God. Berta, does Prudence have a boyfriend? Oh, honey, don't get me started. What does that mean? It means if she gets a high-school diploma before she gets a baby, she'll be the first one in the family. I'm thirsty. What's to drink? The Cransylvania Goofy Juice is mine, but you can have one. Oh, thanks, handsome. Is this beer for anybody? - Prudence, you're 16. - You know, Prudence, the Goofy Juice has vitamin C and calcium. It's much better than beer for a growing body. Not that your body needs to grow. I'm done. You know, Prudence, I'm the third fastest runner in my class. - Cool! - Spring break's over. Back to work. Later, stud. Boy, she smells good. Yeah, if you like Camel Filters and pheromones. I gotta do some grocery shopping for your brother. I'll be back in a little while. - What about Prudence? - She'll be fine. Just keep her out of the liquor cabinet. Don't do anything stupid or you'll go to jail. - Why would you go to jail? - Well, that's kind of complicated. And why was Uncle Charlie kissing Rose? - Well, that was the - And what are pherobones? That one I know, and it's pronounced pheromones Never mind. Wow, you're really good at that. Thanks. I took some cosmetology courses. I figure I'll be a beautician, or a supermodel. Cool. - You want another Goofy Juice? - Aren't you the sweetest. That's twice he's done that. You gotta admit, she did a nice job on those windows. Jake, you need to get started on that book report. - But Prudence is thirsty. - I'll take care of Prudence. - Come on, get going. - Man! - Charlie, you want to - Not a chance in hell. Remember when you used to say that about us? - Here. - Thanks. Where's my little pal? - He has work to do. Kind of like you. - Are you gonna tell on me? No, it was just Just an observation. Just calling them as I see them. Glean from it what you will. - What are you talking about? - I'm not really sure anymore. But I do want you to know that I understand how angry and powerless you feel. Believe it or not, I was a teenager once, too. And I can remember what it's like to rebel against parental authority. Or in your case, grandparental authority. - Can you put some of this on my back? - No. If you don't, I'll burn. If I do, I will. - Judith. What a surprise. - Hello, Charlie. So, - what's new? - Where's Jake? In his room, doing a book report. Well, how can he do a book report when he left the book at my house? That little dickens. Trying to pull the wool over our eyes. - I'll take care of this right now. Bye. - Charlie, I want to see Jake. Sure. Hang on. Jake? Your mother's here! - What? - Your mom's here. Talk to your mom. - Here he is. - Hi, Mom. Hi, sweetie. Are you having a fun weekend? You know Berta, Uncle Charlie's housekeeper Of course she knows her. Who doesn't know Berta? - She brought her granddaughter over. - Yeah. Sweet little kid. That's nice. Have you been playing with her? Oh, yeah. I mean, he has. Not me. Hey, Judith. What's up? Well, it turns out this little rascal was pulling a fast one on us. Doing a book report without the book. Oh, Jake. All right, young man, you get to work right now. - Jake? - Oh, yeah. So, thanks for stopping by. I guess I'll see you when you come to pick him up. - What's going on here? - Nothing. What? Oh, hi, Judith. Did you hear the good news? Charlie and I are back together. Oh, really? Yep. That's what's going on here. Well, just show a little discretion in front of my son, Charlie. Absolutely. - You got that, Rose? Discretion. - Got it, Monkey Man. I think I have a concussion. Thanks for helping me with my book report, Prudence. Oh, no problem. Fourth-grade stuff is easy for me. Should be, you did it twice. Let's go before we miss the bus. - Later, handsome. - Bye. So, what are we doing tonight, sweetie? Rose, I really appreciate your help, but you don't have to pretend to be my girlfriend anymore. Oh, no. Are you pretending to break up with me? Oh, God. Hey. Prudence, what the hell are you doing here? - I had a fight with my grandmother. - So? When I have a fight with my grandmother, I don't come to your house. I know, I'm sorry. I just didn't know where else to go and I thought you were cool. Look, Prudence, this just can't happen. I mean, you're very nice and pretty, but in prison, so am I. Bitching house, man. You should rent it to MTV. - Who the hell are you? - What's going on? Put down the toothbrush, Alan, we've got bigger problems than gingivitis. What's she doing here? Who the hell is this? This is Freddie. My fianc. - 'Sup. - 'Sup? I'll tell you what's 'sup. I'm 'sup. And I should be seeping. Sleeping. What's going on here? Well, Freddie came over to announce our engagement, and Nana threw him out. Really? She didn't take a shine to Bazooka Joe here? You know, I'm kind of more of an acquired taste. So we just need a place to crash tonight because tomorrow we're gonna go to Vegas and get married. - Oh, Prudence, that's a terrible idea. - Yeah. If you leave right now, you can beat the traffic. We can't go tonight. He's gotta pick up his last paycheck from the photomat. Yeah, $218. I'll give you $300 to leave right now. - Charlie, we can't let them go. - Why not? Because they're stupid and they'll die. - What's going on? - Hey, handsome. - Who's he? - This is Freddie, my fianc. - You're marrying him? - Freddie, this is Jake. 'Sup. Charlie, I saw the lights come on, is everything okay? Yeah, Rose, everything's fine. She's your girlfriend but she doesn't sleep here? Yeah, what's up with that, Charlie? - I told you they'd be here. - Come here, you little snot bubble. What do you think you're doing with my baby girl? Mom, leave him alone! I love him. Give me a break, Prudence. You're 16 years old, and your hormones are doing all your thinking for you. Hi, you must be Charlie. Hi. - That's it, we're outta here. - But, Mom - Grandma! - Oh, shut up, both of you! - Can I at least give him my number? - He's got your number, sweetheart. I guess I'll take the couch. Okay, I'm going! Don't you ever come back! Ready for bed, lamb chop? It was worth a shot. - Is Mom here yet? - No. - Sit down a minute, Jake, okay? - Did I do something wrong? No. - We just want to talk. - Okay. What do you want to talk about? Well, you know how I've always told you that you should always tell your parents the truth, no matter what? Well, forget it. Charlie. Jake, it's just that We're just saying a lot of things happened here this weekend, and it's not really necessary that your mother know about them. So you want me to lie? No, it's not really lying. When a boy becomes a man, and that's what you're becoming. - Right, Charlie? - Oh, yeah, a man. He has to start protecting the women in his life from certain things. Like the truth. Do you understand? I think so. You don't want Mom to know about Prudence and her boyfriend and everything. Good man. - Hi, Judith. - Hello, Alan. - Charlie. - Judith. - You ready to go, sweetheart? - Yep. How was your weekend? Uncle Charlie says I don't have to tell you. English   





                    			Here, try this. - What is it? - Just try it. Hey, that's good. Of course it is. It's chicken in frumunda sauce. Frumunda sauce? Yeah, from unda' the toilet. Get it, Dad? Yeah, I get it. I got it 30 years ago, the first time he said it. Yeah, but it's new to him. Check this out. Hey, Jake? What do you call the red mushy stuff between the elephant's toes? - What? - Slow-moving natives. I love this kid. He's a comedy blank slate. I'm glad you do, but you might not want to share your chopsticks with him. - I think he's coming down with something. - Oh, no. He thinks it's a head cold but it's snot. Wait a minute, you don't know that one, either? I have so much to teach you, grasshopper. Do you know how to make arm farts? Charlie? Not at the dinner table. I'll show you later. Before I forget, you got plans for tomorrow night? - No. - Make some. - I'm gonna need the house to myself. - Fine. Don't you want to know why? Jake, if you're done, you can go to your room and start your homework. This is about sex, right? Kids today, huh? Doesn't know frumunda sauce but gets why I need the house. I got a bunch of jokes you're gonna love in a year or two. - Cool! - Go. You think I'm just a kid but I'm snot. Wait, that's not right. Okay, have you ever had revenge sex? Hang on. Jake, are you in your room? Yeah! Revenge sex. Is that anything like pity sex? Whole different animal. Let me break it down for you. There's this woman, Kathy, who lives up the beach. Beautiful woman, I've wanted her for years. Only one problem. She's married to kind of a friend of mine. Kind of a friend? Well, I never really liked him, but he had a hot wife. So, the sanctity of marriage does slow you down a bit. - I'm impressed. - Thank you. But then I catch a break. He cheats on her with her best friend. She throws him out. So now I'm thinking she is gonna want justice. Justice meaning revenge sex with you? You see it, too, huh? You're gonna exploit someone's anger and grief for your own animal gratification. Hey, I don't bitch about your hobbies. She's coming over here on Sunday, so I want you to be out of the way, because we'll probably be moving from room to room. I'll catch a movie. Just mop up when you're done. You got it. Don't take things off his plate. He's coming down with something. Relax. I never get sick. Boy, is he sick. Well, I can't say he didn't warn me. How you feeling? Horrible. - Is that tea? - Yeah. I know I said I wanted you out of the house for my date tonight, but you're obviously indisposed, so don't worry about it. Thank you. Just stay in your room so the coughing and hacking doesn't kill the mood. Anything else I can do to enhance your evening? Well, you know how to work my camcorder? I'm bored. What are we gonna do today? I don't know. Why don't we make some lunch and figure something out? - Cool. - Excuse me? Hasn't anybody noticed I'm sick and miserable here? Yes, Alan, we noticed. Which is why we're gonna make like hockey players and get the puck out of here. Get it, Dad? Puck's not a bad word, but it sounds like one. Yeah, hilarious. Hey, Uncle Charlie, let's make like soccer players and get our big leather balls out of here. Good one. You know, I caught this from you. How come you're not sick? I am. See? He's just not being a baby about it. - Hi. - Perfect. Rose, this isn't the best time. Alan's pretty sick. Oh, no! Poor Alan. Is Charlie taking good care of you? Not really. Would you like me to take care of you? Not really. Don't be silly. Move over. Rose, what are you doing? I'm transmitting healing energy from my body to yours. Looks like you're in good hands. Come on, Jake. I don't think that's gonna help him. No, but it helps us. Is he gonna be able to take me back to Mom's later? Don't worry. If he can't, I will. Hey, how can you tell if an elephant's been in your refrigerator? - How? - There's footprints in the cheesecake. But we don't have a cheesecake. That's the part you don't buy? Do you feel the healing energy? If I say yes, will you get off me? - Hello? - Mom? For God's sake, Alan, I sit on that couch. Mom, I'm sick. We're all sick, darling, but we use discretion. No, he has the flu, Evelyn. You poor baby. What can Mommy do for you? It's okay. I'll manage. Don't be ridiculous. Now what do you need? I don't know. I am kind of thirsty. Well, then, you should be drinking lots of fluids. Okay. Would you like a nice hot bowl of my special chicken noodle soup? That would be nice. Rose, call Greenblatt's and have them send over some soup. As a matter of fact, I'm famished. Order me Order me a turkey on rye with maybe a little Swiss. On second thought, delivery takes forever. Would you care to join me for lunch? Well, what about Alan? We'll have something sent back for him. Okay. So, what's Charlie been up to? Well, what do you know about revenge sex? Quite a bit, actually. I'm still thirsty. Hey. Looking good. That's not very hygienic. We wash dishes in that sink. Well, somebody does. Did the chicken soup Mom sent over from Greenblatt's ever show up? Nope. Well, I'm glad you got some rest, because I have got great news. There is no great news. There's no light at the end of the tunnel. There is no silver lining. There is just this hell on earth. And the slow wait for the sweet release of death. Okay. Let's call it good news. The girl I'm going out with tonight needs a date for her sister. Are you insane? No, but I hear the sister's a bit of a freak. Jake? Jake, go to your room. If you want to talk about sex, why don't you go to your room? - Now! - Fine. First of all, I don't want to talk about dating in front of my son while his mother and I are in the middle of a divorce. Okay. That's very caring and sensitive. Now let me tell you about Revenge Sex's little sister, Casual. Alright, even if I weren't deathly ill, which I am, I wouldn't go on a blind double date with you. - Why not? - Summer of my junior year? The Seals and Crofts concert? You got the incredible cheerleader and I got her sister, The Incredible Hulk? She really took a shine to you. Sure did. "Sarah like puny Alan. " You weren't complaining when you were on her shoulders shouting Summer Breeze! Forget it, Charlie, forget it. Alan, trust me. I've seen the sister. Her name is Desiree. I don't care what her name is. Desiree, Alan. That's like desire with a "yay" at the end. - She's an actress on some soap opera. - Really, which one? I don't know. The Bold and the Bulimic, or something. Are you guys done yet? Yeah, we're done. Now we're gonna get your father back on his feet. How? Well, would you like to go see a bunch of naked boobs? - Sure! - Charlie! This was a dirty trick, Uncle Charlie. So we just sit here and be hot? Yep. This sucks. That's good. Get it out now, because most women hate that noise. I'm not going on a date, Charlie. You don't know that. I didn't start this day thinking we'd all be sitting bare-ass naked, but here we are. Hey, Dad, want to hear a funny joke? Sure, why not? Okay, there's a priest, a minister, and a rabbit. It's a rabbi, Jake. Oh, yeah. Okay. A priest, a minister, and a rabbi. I forgot the rest. I gotta go to the bathroom. Wait. You know why they call this a European health spa? Because you're a-peein'. He's gonna kill at school tomorrow. Charlie, I'm not going on a date. Oh, come on, Alan. If you don't do this, then I'm not gonna get the revenge sex. And I really want the revenge sex. I really do. I'm sorry. It's not that I don't appreciate you, pimping me out on my deathbed. It's just that I'm not ready to date. Not ready? If you think you're protecting Jake by living like a monk, you're wrong. He needs to know that his father's moving on with his life, that he's happy. It's not about Jake. I haven't been on a date since college. There's nothing to worry about. Just be yourself. The one woman who knows me better than anyone in the world threw me out. So "be yourself" is not exactly comforting advice. Good point. Okay, look at it this way. It took your wife 12 years to get sick of you. All we gotta do here is snow some broad for one night. A priest, a minister, and a rabbi walk into a barn. It's a bar, Jake. Not a barn. A bar. It is? Now I get it. That's funny. Okay, I dropped Jake off at his mom's, and the girls should be here in a little while for drinks. Is this the sister? Desiree Barrington from The Young and the Restless? Yeah. You want me to go on a date with Desiree Barrington? Yeah. I'm healed. It's a miracle. Attaboy. Are you okay? Yeah. Why? Well, you're coughing, you're sweating. Charlie, you're burning up. No, your hand is freezing. I think you're coming down with what I've got. Don't be ridiculous. I never get sick. Now, listen, I made reservations at the Ivy. I figure we'll take them out for an early dinner and then And then what? Hang on a second. Anyway, we'll take them to the Ivy Here. This'll make you feel better. Thanks. Okay. Why don't you go upstairs and change because we really want to look our best for our dates. What are you talking about? I'm not going on a date. Yeah, you are. Come on, Charlie. Desiree Barrington. Nominated for two Daytime Emmys. Named "Most Promising Ingnue" by Soap Opera Digest. She totally revitalized Young and the Restless. Occasionally I have lunch at my desk and watch a little TV. Tell Jake I loved him. Please, Charlie. I was gonna suck it up for you. No, you weren't. Okay, you got me. Look, you helped me feel better, and now I'll help you. You want to help me, Alan? Find a gun and shoot me in the eye. No, I was thinking I could give you a chiropractic adjustment. You could also do my hair, but what would be the point? Chiropractics is not just about back ailments. It's a holistic approach to wellness that includes unblocking pathways in the nervous system so that the body can heal itself. Excuse me? What is Alan. I never told you this before, but I guess now is as good a time as any. I think what you do for a living is a total crock. What? Don't take it personally. But you chiropractor guys are just masseuses without the happy endings, right? You think I'm some kind of phony? That my profession is some kind of con? Well, let's be honest. You only became a chiropractor because you couldn't get into medical school. I got into medical school! I just didn't want to spend four years in Guadalajara. So instead you spent, what, two weeks at Back Snapper U? It was two years. And since we're being honest, let me tell you about what I think about what you do, Mr. Jingle Writer. You're not a musician, you're a salesman. You know what you sell? Crap! Granny's Big Fudge Nuggets? Maple Loops? Hey, Maple Loops is part of a nutritious, balanced breakfast. Yeah, if you eat it with a steak and some broccoli. And let me tell you another thing. You had a shot at a real career. You could've played in great bands. You could've been a respected studio musician. Don't you think I wanted that? I tried, Alan, and I failed. The truth is, if I hadn't started writing jingles, I'd be playing faculty mixers at the Guadalajara Medical School. Since you're being honest, I guess I can admit, I didn't really get into Guadalajara. I guess neither of us is doing exactly what we dreamed about when we were kids. I guess not. But you know, we could be doing a lot worse. Yes, we could. Excuse me. You know what's nice, though? This. Right now. Taking care of each other, like we did when we were kids. Well, no one else was gonna take care of us. - We were on our own. - Yeah. Dad was gone and Mom was What are you doing? Hey! How do you feel? Actually, a little better. Total crock, huh? Lay down, I'll do your back. - No, I'm fine, thanks. - No, really, it'll help. I mean it, Alan. Keep your hands away from me. Come on, don't be such a baby. I'm not a baby. I just don't like a man touching me. I let you do it to me once, that was enough. And you liked it. Now come on, just let me finish the job, and you'll be ready for when the women get here. - No. - Just relax. Come on. Wait. Car doors. They're here. How do I look? Good. Me? Very nice. Thank you. Was that the doorbell? Alan, relax. Chicks are always late. I guess. What about that? - What about what? - The doorbell. Alan, relax. Chicks are always late. I guess. Now, that was the doorbell.

                    			The kick is up, it's long enough. The kick is no good. Yes! - Yeah! - Who won? Who cares? We covered the spread. Charlie, call me an old-fashioned dad, but I was hoping my son wouldn't start betting on sports until he was old enough to have a drinking problem. He didn't really make a bet. I just gave him a taste of my action. Nor do I want him tasting your action. Dad, without action, there's no juice. All of a sudden he's Frank Sinatra. - I bet that's the pizza. - What's the spread? Pepperoni. What's next, Charlie? You gonna teach him how to shoot craps? He already knows how to shoot craps. I just wish I could teach him not to bet the hard eight. Mr. Harper, here you go, nice and hot. I threw in some extra garlic puffs as well. Thanks, pal. Thank you, Mr. Harper. If there's anything at all you ever need, please call. You know, pizza, dry-cleaning, pot, women. - How much did you tip him? - I don't know, I gave him $50. That's like a 300 tip. If you say so. I was never good at math. Yeah, but you can figure out the point spread, the over-under and the vigorish on every football game in the country. What can I tell you? I've got a beautiful mind. Morning, Berta. Need some help? Yeah. Come to my house and explain to my daughter that we don't put up bail for cute guys with Costa Rican passports. - Morning. - I got your groceries, Charlie. You owe me $74. - Why didn't you just use my credit card? - I tried. Funny story. My platinum card. Look what they did to my platinum card. They decapitated my holographic eagle. Yeah, that's sad. You owe me $74. Relax, I'll write you a check. Berta, I'm good for $74. There's an assistant store manager with bad skin and a pair of scissors who begs to differ. He obviously made a mistake. Leave it to me, I'll straighten it out. Alan, what do I do? Call the bank that issued the card and figure out what's going on. Good idea. How do I get the number? It's usually on the back of the card. Okay, this may take a while. Are you sure? Okay, thanks. I don't believe it. None of my bills have been paid in four months. My credit is shot. All my cards are dead. You don't have to worry about paying me this week. Thank you, Berta. I'll just take this espresso maker and be on my way. Call me when things pick up. Charlie, why haven't you been paying your bills? Alan, I don't pay my own bills. I've got a guy. Do you think you might want to call your guy? Don't talk down to me, Alan. I'm not stupid. That's the first call I made. - And? - And his number is not in service at this time. Wonderful building. What's wrong with it? The phrase "reeks of urine" comes to mind. Here we are. That's seldom a good sign. - Hello, Stan? - Who wants to know? It's Charlie Harper. Charlie! Good to see you. Come on in. Just don't rip the tape, they check. So what's going on? What can I do you for? Stan, I've got a problem. Yeah, I know the feeling. Sit down, talk to me. Come on. All of my credit cards are dead. And they tell me the bills haven't been paid in four months. Yeah, that sounds about right. Excuse me, maybe this is none of my business, but how does something like that happen? In layman's terms, your brother ran out of money. What? How did I run out of money? I knew you'd ask that. Let me demonstrate. Think of this water as cash flow, which, for you, would be royalties from your jingles, right? And this cup, your financial well-being. This little hole would be your expenses. You dig? Now, Charlie, with most people, when money comes in, it drips out and pays their bills with a healthy reserve for emergencies. But with you, however This is what I love about you, Charlie. You spend it as quick as you get it. You see, you don't drip, you hemorrhage. Look at that. But when the cash flow starts to slow down, there's no reserve. Okay. But what happened to my money? Artists. Where would we be without them? What I don't understand is why you didn't warn him this was happening. Okay, mea culpa. Look, I've been a little distracted lately. Slight problem with the feds. Are you embezzling from my brother? Embezzle what? Hello! I thought you were the smart one. No, this is a totally unrelated, import-export problem, all right? I just cannot believe that one of the piatas showed up at a kids' party. Oh, boy. This has been a blast. Don't get me wrong, but I have a plane to catch right now. I'll tell you what, just feel free and browse through all your files. Listen, Charlie, I'm running a little short on cash, so maybe you Look who I'm asking! It was great meeting you, sport. Ciao. And you were worried. The good news is that a substantial amount of royalties is gonna come in in the next couple of months. Great. Problem solved. Let's go out to dinner. - No, problem not solved. - But I'm hungry. Get used to it. It's going to take a while to pay off all the bills your accountant ignored, so until then, you're gonna have to cut back. - But you said I got money coming. - Shall I go get the paper cup? Okay. What do we cut? Let's look at your expenses. First thing is, we stop paying your accountant. That's a little cold, isn't it? He's great, I've known him for years. He's going through a rough patch. - Charlie, you're broke. - You're right, screw him. What's next? You have a gardener. Why do you have a gardener? To tend my garden. Garden? You mean the two potted palms on the deck? Water them yourself. Okay, but I'm gonna have to buy a hose and one of those watering things, so isn't that kind of a push? Gone. Now, "Ultimate Premiere Satellite package"? That's really cool. I get every sporting event in the world. If a kid in Madagascar throws a rock at a tree, I can see it and bet on it. It's gone. Oh, man. We can keep the cable, though, right? You have satellite and cable? Sometimes there's solar flares. Okay, we can cut back to basic cable. Basic cable? That's what they get in prison. - Hey, what you doing? - Bad time, Rose. Money problems? - How did you know? - I bought your espresso maker from Berta. I got a great deal 'cause she didn't want to carry it on the bus. Wonderful. Charlie, "miscellaneous cash expenses"? What exactly is that? I don't know. Go see a movie, buy a hot dog, stuff like that. It was $80,000 last year. That. That's women and gambling. Gone and gone. Great. Why don't I just shoot myself? You can't afford a gun. You know, I could lend you some money, Charlie. That's very sweet, Rose, but I don't really want to shoot myself. The way I see it, you're either gonna have to slash expenses, or find the money to pay your bills someplace else. Okay. - I'll borrow on the house. - You've already got three mortgages. - Is that a lot? - Not if you have three houses. Let me ask you a tough question. What would you think about going to Mom for a short-term loan? Interesting idea. I think I'd rather have a pack of hyenas tear out and devour my intestines. Yeah, I know. I can't afford hyenas. Look, you know I'd help you if I could, but all my money's going to my former wife, my former house, my former wife's current lawyers and all their descendants. So if you don't want to go to Mom, you're gonna have to change your lifestyle for a few months. Fine. You win. I win? What do I win? How is this a win for me? Whatever. I'll cut back, like you said. Now come on, let's all go out for a nice dinner. I'm buying. Great. Then after we can stop by my place for espresso. Good idea. That's a money saver. "Save 50 cents on one regular-sized Hamburger Helper "when you buy two of the following Screw it. - Hi. - Hi. How do you like that cabernet? - It's very good. - I'll have to try it sometime. And excuse me for saying so, but you really don't need the Lean Cuisine. Thank you. So, how do you like this cheese? That. I do a little volunteer work making sandwiches for a homeless shelter. I don't know if you know this, but a lot of those homeless fellas like a little snort once in awhile. Okay. Seek and ye shall find. Twenty-four rolls of toilet paper for $3.99. I know what you're thinking, it's single-ply, but at this price, you can double up, triple up, go wild! Okay, have a nice day. I can't do this anymore, Alan. I quit. You can't quit poverty, Charlie. I want the good stuff. I want cheese that isn't air-dropped into third-world countries. I want ouchless toilet paper. I want vodka that doesn't look like Fred Flintstone would drink it. I want my life back. Fine, then swallow your pride, call Mom, and ask her to lend you some money. Yabba-dabba-doo. Who's the favorite? - Green Bay. - Did you bet them? No. You took the Redskins? - No action? - None. - Then why are we watching? - Beats the hell out of me. Anybody want a snack? Pizza's here. You ordered a pizza? Charlie, you're supposed to be cutting back on expenses. Alan, it's a pizza, not a hooker. Hey, Mr. Harper. Good to see you. I threw in some of those garlic puffs you like. Grabbed a bottle of house red. I don't think they'll miss it. Thanks, buddy. Here's for the pizza and Charlie. Can I speak with you for a minute? Hang on a sec. - What are you planning on tipping him? - I don't know. Give him $2. That's 15. - I can't do that. - You have to. I can't. Did you see his face? Go. - There you go. - Thank you, Mr. Harper. These are ones. Yeah. I can break $100. Yeah, I'm having kind of a cash flow problem. Yeah. Well, we had a good run. Wait. - Here. - No, keep it. You need it more than I do. So, Deborah said that Julie had an addiction to cosmetic procedures. And I said, "Well, then she needs to go to BOTOX detox. " Everyone laughed and laughed, but, of course, you couldn't tell 'cause none of their faces were moving. That's pretty funny, Mom. Listen Right. You wanted to tell me something. Yeah. Maybe you should sit down. What now? You got some girl pregnant? You're gay? You're on drugs? $10 says pregnant. - Jake, go to your room. - I'm giving odds. Go. Okay. Here's the thing. Would you like a drink? I suppose. A screwdriver might be nice. I can't go through with this, Alan. Sure you can. She'll make a couple of snide comments about your frivolous lifestyle, which luckily, she doesn't know the half of. You'll just suck it up, pay her back in a couple of months and that'll be that. With Mom, "that" is never "that. " The guilt is always there. To this day, she still reminds me how much she had to sacrifice just so I could get braces. Like I deliberately had crooked teeth so she'd be forced to drive a domestic car. - All right, then just drop it. - It's dropped. - Don't ask her. - I won't. - Let it go. - It's gone. By the way, they're about to repossess your Jaguar. Mommy? Very nice. So, how much do you need? I admit that my lifestyle has been a little frivolous and I probably should have been paying closer attention to my expenses. All right. How much do you need? This is just a temporary thing, couple of months. - How much? - You'll get it back. This isn't like the braces and the Mercury Capri. Charlie, give me a number. I really appreciate this, Mom. No more need be said. You'll pay it back when you can. Thanks. All right. Now that that's taken care of, why don't I take my boys out to dinner? There it is! Everything's got a price. - Charlie, what are you - No. She can't just do something nice, there's gotta be strings attached. Nothing's given out of love. Everything's got a hook in it! You can keep your money, lady, because I'm a free man, and I can't be bought. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go hide my car. They're gonna take my Jag away Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute? I guess. How come it's so dark in here? Do you have any idea how much electricity costs? No. I didn't, either, but it turns out it's quite a racket. Listen. I know you're going through a tough time and I really wanna help you out. So, please take this. This is a cashier's check. Where did you get a cashier's check? From my dad's bank, silly. Your dad owns a bank? Not all by himself. Me and my brother and sister own 49. Really? What about your mom? She doesn't have a bank. - I see. - She's in oil. - So you really have - Yep, more than God. Didn't figure that when you dumped me, did you? Rose, it wouldn't have mattered. I know. That's one of the things I love about you. You discard women regardless of their financial status. Thanks. But I can't take this. You think I'm crazy, don't you? My dad and brother said I was crazy, but I think that was to form a power block to squeeze me off the Board of Directors. Shame on them. I told them that you'd help me if I needed it. I mean, you're the first guy I've ever met who hasn't cared about my money. Who slept with me because he was drunk, not because I was rich. I only wanted to help you because I thought that we were friends. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I am crazy. No, Rose, it's fine. I am your friend. And if it means that much to you, I'll take the money. Thank you, Charlie. How can I ever repay you? Don't worry about it. And I will pay you back. I know that. Better I should owe you than my manipulating, scheming mother. That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me. Hang on, I'll grab you a tissue. Thank you. English   





                    			There we go. Watch your step. - I can't feel my face, Charlie. - You just had two wisdom teeth pulled. Watch the drool. Look at that. - That is a very sexy woman. - I'm sorry, that arouses you? - How you doing? - Hey. Charlie, walk away. Relax. This could be interesting. You got a nice swing. Thanks. Try stepping in to it. You will get more power that way. You mean like this? Yeah. Dial one and the area code, because that is long-distance. Charlie, let's go, this woman is clearly a lunatic. Yeah, but look at the passion, the fire, the ass. Is this your car? - Do I look crazy to you? - Well, frankly - So whose car is it? Cheating boyfriend? - No. Psychiatrist. Charlie, psychiatrist. - What more do you need to hear? - Hang on. - So, you are beating up your shrink's car? - He said I have anger issues. The quack. - Then he hit on me. - The horny quack. - Hold this for me. - Good, I'm on deck. Man, this is going to take forever. Either one of you guys got an ice pick? Don't cars like this usually have an alarm system? Thanks a lot. - Let's get out of here, Charlie. - Hey! You are not just going to leave me here, are you? Yes. - Alan. - Charlie! So, how come Mush Mouth gets shotgun? Damn shrink. Anti-depressants, tranquilizers, sleeping pills. - You want any of these? - No, thanks. No, I'm good. Are you sure, because you seem a little edgy? No, I'm a lot edgy. Isn't throwing that stuff on the road a little dangerous? To who? Raccoons? They can't get past the childproof cap. - I got to say, I really appreciate this, guys. - No problem. Big problem. - Frankie. - Charlie. - Awan. - Awan? Not "Awan," Awan. Is Awan a little slow? Yeah. But I make up for it by being a little fast. - I know your type. - You do? Yep. Don't care for it particularly. So, where can we drop you? That's the thing. I really don't have anywhere to stay. Why? Did you escape from some place? Great. Pot shots from Spittle Boy. And if you must know, I'm having family problems. Charlie, you wouldn't happen to know of a place I could crash tonight, would you? Crap! Here we are. Chez Charlie. Great house! Oh, wow. You are right on the beach. I have got to go for a swim. - She's taking her clothes off. - Yeah. Is this a great country or what? - Hi, Dad. Hey, Uncle Charlie. - Hey, guys. Rose, what are you doing? - We are playing Mummy on a Chair. - I'm the mummy. Judith, hi. - Is Jake ready to go? - Hang on. Jake, your mom's here. Charlie, why don't you go out on the deck and keep an eye out for approaching squalls? I'm on it. It's squall season. - Hi, Mom. - Hi, sweetheart. - What is he doing? - He's playing Mummy on a Chair. Where is the chair? I don't know the rules, Judith. Hi, Rose. Thanks for babysitting. - No problem. We had fun. - Good. - So who's the naked lady? - Not really sure. She was trashing a car with a baseball bat when we left the dentist's office and, you know, one thing kind of led to another. So you met cute, that's nice. But you know, you may want to be careful with a girl like that, Charlie. One day it's baseball bats and windshields, the next day you wake up with your testicles Superglued to your thigh. - Point taken. - I'm sorry about that, by the way. Water under the bridge. Hurry up, Jake. Your mother's waiting. Remember, I'm bringing him back tomorrow night so I can see my parents. Why is there a woman's shoe on your floor? Apparently, Mummy on a Chair is a very complex game. - Bye, Dad. - See you, pal. Tell your brother he is a pig. I will leave a note on the fridge. - God, I needed that. - Me, too. It's like all my insanity and rage have just been washed away. That's good. Because, you know, all your drugs are on the Coast Highway. Where can I take a nice hot shower? I said where, not with whom. You guys are so cute. Right back at you. Good, Charlie. Keep hitting on the deranged woman. While you are at it, why don't you try humping a bear trap? Alan, open your eyes. That is an intriguing and exciting woman. A rare and magnificent jewel. - She's hot and you are horny. - I'm saying. - I just love warm sake. - Me, too. Tora, tora, tora! You know, Frankie, there are many fine hotels in the area. - I can't stay in a hotel. - Why not? That is a very good question. So, where you from? Guess. - I wouldn't know where to begin. - Okay. Here I am yakking about myself. What about you guys? Alan, what do you do? Good question. Guess. How about that? - Alan, don't be childish. - She started it. He is a chiropractor. Really? That's terrific. I have so much respect for what you guys do. - Seriously? - Yeah. Thank you. See that, Charlie? My brother thinks I'm just a glorified masseuse. I never said glorified. Charlie, you are so wrong. Chiropractors are like angels of healing. These hands have amazing powers to bring relief and even pleasure. Hey, these aren't exactly hooks. - Do you get regular chiropractic work? - Are you kidding? Once a week. In fact, I'm in desperate need of an adjustment right now. - Let me get my table, I will fix you up. - Awesome. Do you want me with clothes or without? Are they looking for me? You didn't say anything, did you? I got to go. I love you. I will see you soon. Come in. Hi. I was just going to go to bed and wanted to see if you needed anything, towels, sheets, vodka? No, I'm great, thanks. Alan got me totally jelled out with that adjustment. Man, you are so lucky to have him right here in this house. Yeah, I'm living a dream. So, listen, if you need to talk to somebody about, you know, anything, I'm here. I see that. Okay, then. Yeah. I think you are a really cool guy. Yeah. But I'm not going to have sex with you. - Ever? - Good night, Charlie. Good night. Okay. Round one to the hot, crazy chick. Man, deep tissue massage, pancakes. If you had a TV on your forehead and could breathe through the ears you'd be perfect. So nobody makes you pancakes where you live? Not your husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, mother, father, grandma, cellmate? Round two. - Morning, Frankie. - Morning, Charlie. - Morning. - Yeah. So, Frankie. Boy, that is a pretty name. - How did you sleep? - Great. Except, I had this wild erotic dream. And I woke up all drenched in sweat. - Could you pass the syrup? - Sure. Yeah. Thanks, sweetie. You are a doll. You know, I can't thank you guys enough for letting me stay here last night. I just wish there was some way I could repay you. For a start, you could tell us something about yourself. Anything, really. I wouldn't mind hearing more about that dream. All right. I guess I can trust you guys. Charlie, Alan. I know this may sound totally crazy but I work for a secret government agency, and my current mission is I'm sorry. You should see your faces. You guys are so easy. All right, I'm going to go take a bath. Who wants to scrub my back? Too late! Sometimes I just crack me up. So, what have you got going for today? Nothing. I was just going to hang around the house. Yeah. Me, too. - No work? No errands? - Not a thing. - Maybe you could see a movie. - I've seen a movie. Come on, Alan. - Why are you doing this? - Doing what? Why don't you admit that you are interested in Frankie? I'm not. - You are not? - Honest to God. Fine. But hypothetically, if I were interested in her, would you care? Of course I would. You are my brother. I don't want to see you get your feelings hurt. You just assume that if we are both interested in the same woman you would come out on top? - Aren't you going to say anything? - What? There was no question there. - God, you are such an arrogant jerk. - See, your feelings are hurt. My feelings are fine. I think the real issue here is Frankie likes me better and it's driving you crazy. No. What's driving me crazy is that you fought tooth and nail to keep the lunatic out of this house, but now that she is here, you want her. I never said I wanted her. But you think that if you did want her, you could have her even if I wanted her, too. - Aren't you going to say something? - There was no question there. Okay. Fine. Take your best shot. Let me just give you a little heads up. - I am way out in front. - Yeah? How do you figure? Frankie and I have already discussed having sex. What are you doing? I just thought Frankie might like some fresh towels. I already gave her fresh towels. Really? Well, aren't you Toweley Towellerson all of a sudden. - You know, Alan, it's not my fault. - What's not your fault? That I've always been more successful with women than you. Have been, Charlie. Have been. We are not teenagers anymore. Your bad-boy act just might be wearing just a little thin. - Or you just might be a little jealous. - Jealous? Don't me. When the occasion calls for I have every right to What? I thought we were doing funny noises. That was an elephant. - Yeah, elephant. - It was good. Yeah. Really good. I'm ready to go. Can one of you guys give me a ride? - Absolutely. - Sure. - Great. Who's driving? - I will. - I got the Jag. - I got the Volvo. - Mine's faster. - Mine's safer. - Alan, stop competing with me. - Why don't you stop competing with me? - Why should I stop? I'm winning. - Like hell you are. - Like hell I am. Ask Frankie. - Why don't you ask Frankie? - I don't need to ask her. - What are you afraid of? I'm afraid I'm going to hit you so hard I'll be an only child. Yeah? Bring it on. Hey! Stop it! What is wrong with you two? You are family. You are brothers. Do you understand how precious that is? Do you have a clue the pain you feel when a family rips itself apart and there is no one to replace them? I mean, that's it, you know, you are all alone in the world and It's just so horrible. - It's okay. - Yeah, look, we are not fighting. Yeah. We love each other. See? Yeah, and it doesn't matter who drives, you know. We will both come. Good. Let's go. - Nice house. - Yeah. All right, I've just got to pick up a few things and then, I was hoping you could take me to the train station. - The train station? Where are you going? - I don't know. I will figure something out. If it helps any, you are welcome to stay with us for a couple more days. - I couldn't impose. - It's no imposition. - Yeah. We like having you. - Are you sure? It's settled. You are staying with us. Man, how much do I love you guys. I'll be right back. - What a nice girl. - Yeah. Of course, we still don't know a damn thing about her. True. Although that is one big-ass house she lives in. Or is robbing. That would make us the duped getaway drivers. Moron accessories to grand theft. That's a major felony. Yeah. Hard time. I can't do hard time, Charlie. I have allergies. That's going to be your biggest problem. Watch your head, sweetheart. Hi. I'm Joanie. - Hi. - Okay. We can go now. Where are we going, Mommy? We are going to go to Charlie and Alan's house, hon. It's a wonderful place where those awful people will never find us. You were right. We should have taken the Volvo. Stay tuned for scenes from the next Two and a Half Men. Next on Two and a Half Men. Are you guys gay? - Unfit, how? - You know We got to get them out of here. You can take your damn money and stick it up your "white bread, country club, "Tournament of Roses, liposuctioned" ass. I just met your brother's latest stuff. - Why do you assume it's his stuff? - What? Is it yours? No, but it's not his, either. Hold on there, Pecos Bill. No, I like girls. Just not into eight-year-olds. The bad news is that wasn't my shrink's car. It's been so long since anybody's touched me. Come on. Don't you want to spoon? Coffee? I'm the extra guy. I'm wrapped tighter than an airport sandwich. Here, I'm running late. You're going to get laid tonight. Why doesn't she just kick me in the balls? English   





                    			Previously on Two and a Half Men. That is a very sexy woman. - So whose car is it? - Psychiatrist. Let's get out of here, Charlie. You are not just going to leave me here, are you? Here we are. Chez Charlie. - She's taking her clothes off. - Is this a great country or what? You guys are so cute. Right back at you. Good, Charlie. Keep hitting on the deranged woman. Hey, Charlie, you're a really cool guy. But I'm not going to have sex with you. Ever? Deep tissue massage, pancakes. If you had a TV on your forehead and could breathe through the ears you'd be perfect. You just assume that if we are both interested in the same woman - you would come out on top? - Of course I would. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid I'm going to hit you so hard I'll be an only child. - Are you sure? - It's settled. You are staying with us. Of course, we still don't know a damn thing about her. I'm Joanie. Hi. We are going to go to Charlie and Alan's house, hon. It's a wonderful place where those awful people will never find us. So, Frankie, why didn't you tell us you had a daughter? Okay, guys, here's the deal. I didn't want you to know. Okay. I feel better. I'm sorry, it's a long story. We got time. I'm not doing anything. Alan, you doing anything? No, I'm free. I was staying with my grandma and grandpa, who are really rich, and they don't want my mom to have me, so they said she's crazy. That wasn't so long. - Can we please talk about this later? - Okay. What shall we talk about? Are you guys gay? Isn't she something? Okay, here we are. This is it, right? One kid, no pets? As far as I know. - Can I go look at the ocean? - Sure, just stay on the deck. Okay, who has the first question? - Alan. - Thank you. - What the hell is going on? - Good one. Here it is. I married a really rich guy, and his parents always hated me. I don't know. Maybe it was because when we met, he was on the road to becoming a U.S. Congressman and I was just, you know, on the road. Joanie, get off the railing. Anyway, they were not happy when we got married, and they were even less happy when we used part of his trust fund to finance my recording career. - You're a singer? - Well, as it turns out, no. But Then two years ago, Brad died. And ever since, his parents have been trying to take Joanie away from me. - So, the psychiatrist - Court ordered. They're suing me for custody, saying I'm an unfit parent. - Unfit, how? - You know I'm not a lawyer, but taking a baseball bat to the shrink's Beamer might not have helped your case. Yeah, they'll probably spin that one in their favor. But I was screwed anyway because they were paying him to make me look bad. - That's horrible. - So what are your plans now? I don't know. I didn't think past just getting her out of there. You don't have to know. You can stay here for a while and figure it out. Right? - Absolutely. - Thank you. That'd be great. I'll go tell Joanie. Terrific. We're happy to have you. Okay, we've got to get her out of here. - Charlie, she needs us. - She doesn't need us. She needs a lawyer and probably a new shrink. Well, then we'll get her those. At this point, I think I'd like to stop using the word "we. " You're going to bail on her? Two days ago, you couldn't wait to get her in bed. That's because two days ago, she was just a crazy stranger. If I remember correctly, you couldn't wait to get rid of her. Yes, because she was a crazy stranger. Now I've gotten to know her and I want her to stay. All right, Alan, but I'm warning you. This girl's got a lot of baggage. I don't know if you have enough sky cabs to get her to the curb. What? So, Joanie, what grade are you in? - Second. - Really? - I have a little boy who's in fourth. - So? I don't know. I thought it'd be germane to the conversation. Wow. Doesn't matter how old they are, you still strike out. You know, Joanie, you are just as pretty as your mom. So? I bow to the master. Hold on, let me finish. All right, I'm going to say this one more time real slow so there's no confusion. You can take your damn money and stick it up your "white bread, country club, "Tournament of Roses, liposuctioned" ass. Hi. - Really? I'm garbage. - Is Alan here? Really? Is that right? Well, I got news for you, lady. The term is white trash. - Do you know her? - Nope, that's a new one. - Hi, Dad. - Jake, Judith. What are you doing here? Alan, I told you yesterday I was going to visit my parents. Dad's having another colonoscopy. If I'm not there, I'll have to watch the video. Yeah, right. I'm sorry. There's just been a lot of stuff going on. Yeah. I just met your brother's latest stuff. - Why do you assume it's his stuff? - What? Is it yours? No, but it's not his, either. - But it could be. - Says who? Says your ex-wife. Okay, I really don't need to hear this. Jake, honey, have a good time. Charlie, behave yourself. What about me? I am completely capable of having my own stuff. - Hi, I'm Joanie. - Hey. I'm going to go play in my room. - Can I come with you? - Whatever. If he can just keep that attitude for another 30 years, he's gold. I'm not afraid of your lawyers or your shrinks. Fine, bring them on, because you know what? We're going to run away and hide. Now they're really unhappy with me. - Is there anything we can do? - Thanks, you've already done so much. - I just hate to put you out like this. - It is not a problem. We have plenty of space. You and Joanie can stay in my room and I'll bunk with Charlie. You'll bunk with Charlie? - Hold on there, Pecos Bill. - No, it'll be fun. It'll be like when we were kids. Okay. But just remember, this time Mom won't be around to hear you scream. Why are those people here? They're going through a tough time, and we're helping them out. That girl is really annoying. - I think maybe she has a crush on you. - Yeah, that's what's annoying. - You don't really like girls yet? - No, I like girls. Just not into eight-year-olds. Is Joanie okay? Yeah. She fell asleep as soon as her head hit the pillow. - It was a long day for her. - Yeah. The good news is I think my in-laws are going to back off. The bad news is that wasn't my shrink's car. Yeah, well, we all make mistakes. But at least you made this one for the right reason. You love your daughter. I just wish I knew where to go from here. Because I know I seem like I've got it all together, - but this is a little - Scary? Yeah. I understand. When my marriage ended, I was terrified. It's the unknown. - Yeah. - No, don't cry. Everything will work out, you'll see. - What's the matter? - I don't know. It's been so long since anybody's touched me. Come here. - Alan? - Yeah? It's been so long since anybody's touched me. How much did you see? Just enough to make sleep impossible. Okay, that's great. I am dying to talk about this. All we did was kiss, but, Charlie, what a kiss. It was like our souls were merging. - That was saliva, Alan. - No, seriously. I mean, Frankie is incredible. Think about it. First she loses her husband, then she has to fight to keep her daughter, and yet, still she has such incredible spirit, such joie de vivre. Okay, would you like to hear my take on this? Is it positive and life affirming? Good night, Alan. Okay, no. Tell me what you think. All right. I've known you all your life, and if there's one thing I've noticed, you are a stone sucker for the damsel in distress. - I am not. - Come on, Alan. Every woman you've ever been involved with has been damaged and needy. Wait, what about Okay, go on. You devote all your time and energy into fixing them up instead of doing the humane thing, which is to have sex with them and run away. Exactly how is that the humane thing? My way, they have a good time, you have a good time, nobody suffers. Your way, you get married, you take over their lives, they start to hate you, and you end up moving in with me. You know what, Charlie? I think you're jealous. - Of who? - Of me. For the first time in our lives, a woman picked me over you, and you can't deal with it. I can deal with it. I don't get it, but I can deal with it. I feel sorry for you. I feel sorry that your heart has become so hard and small that you've lost the capacity to connect with another human being on any level any more meaningful than the inebriated exchange of bodily fluids. Boy, leave it to you to take a beautiful thing like drunken sex and make it sound dirty. I don't know why I even bother talking to you. - Alan? - What? I thought we had a pact to never go to bed mad. Leave me alone. Come on. Don't you want to spoon? I swear to God, you are going to lose that hand. - That's not my hand. - Mom! - Do you know where Jake is? - No, honey, I'm sorry. - We're playing hide-and-seek. - I don't know where he's hiding. No, I was hiding, and he was supposed to find me. It's been over an hour. - Lf I see him, I'll let him know. - Thank you. You're welcome. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Morning. Morning. - Coffee? - Thank you. So, I thought maybe today, you, me, and the kids might go do something fun. - What about Charlie? - He's had his fun. I know. Why don't we go to Will Rogers State Park and have a picnic? - That sounds nice. - Great. - Morning. - Morning. Oh, man. I'm the extra guy. Don't call yourself extra. - Try superfluous. - Alan. - Fifth wheel, eleventh toe, third nipple. - Alan! Interesting. - What's interesting? - This is new for me. Don't really like it. - Charlie, you're a great guy. - No, please, stop. Do not call me a great guy. That's what you call the schmuck loser friend who has to dance with the hot chick's ugly cousin. - What? - Nothing. Just having a really good day. - Hey, coming on the picnic, Uncle Charlie? - No. Couldn't find a date. Jake, Mom wants to know if you want egg salad or tuna for lunch. - Tuna. - Me, too. God, she's annoying. At least you're not a third nipple. Jake, why don't you go in the kitchen and help Joanie pick out some snacks for the picnic basket? You sure you don't want to come with us? - Do you really want me to come with you? - No, I was just being polite. Listen, Frankie, we need to talk about you and Alan. Come on, stud. - You're not jealous, are you? - No. Dumbfounded, maybe. Mystified, astounded, flabbergasted, but not jealous. I just want to make sure that you understand how vulnerable he is. You don't think I'm vulnerable, too? Maybe you haven't noticed, Charlie, but I'm wrapped tighter than an airport sandwich. Okay, let me put it this way, my brother is crazy about you. Well, I'm crazy about him, too. No, you don't understand. Alan's a nester. He's already imagining the two of you walking through IKEA, picking out flatware and throw pillows. - Come on. - He did it with me. You really care about him, don't you? Yes. You're a great guy, Charlie. Great guy and a kiss on the cheek. Why doesn't she just kick me in the balls? - Want to play tag? - No. - Hide-and-seek? - No. - Want to chase me? - No. - The kids are having a great time. - This is a wonderful idea, Alan. Thank you. Hey, what makes it wonderful is the company. Do you always say exactly the right thing? I don't know. I suppose I try to be sensitive to the moment and weigh my words so that they're emotional No, not always. Listen, Frankie, I was thinking. We get along so well, and our kids get along, and since neither one of us really has our own place Alan. Absolutely not. - But - No. My life is such a mess, and I've got to straighten out a bunch of things before I can even think about a relationship. Yes, you've got a lot of baggage, but it's nothing I can't get to the curb. - What? - It was something Charlie said. I was hoping you'd know what it meant. No. Alan, I talked to my brother in Seattle today, and he and his wife are going to put me and Joanie up for a while. - You're leaving? - Tomorrow morning. 'Cause, you know, I can enroll her in school there and get a job and start putting my life back together again. Yeah, no. That makes sense. Sure. - I'm sorry. - No. You're doing the right thing. - Look on the bright side, Alan. - What bright side? You're going to get laid tonight. Oh, boy. I think I'm going to cry again. Okay, hon, the cab's waiting. Say goodbye to Jake. - Bye, Jake. - Bye. Oh, man! - Charlie, what can I say? - I know. I'm a great guy. Oh, man! You know, I would've been happy to drive you to the airport. No, it's better to say goodbye here, because LAX is hectic and crazy, and the underwire in my bra always sets off the metal detectors. You know, this doesn't have to be goodbye forever. Once we get all settled, you can come visit us. Sure. Bye. Here, I'm running late. - It's tough seeing her go, isn't it? - Yeah. I'm really going to miss Joanie. English   





                    			- Hey! There he is! High five! - Down low. Too slow. Come here, clown. Upside down. - Hello, Charlie. - Judith, how's it going? Hey, Uncle Charlie, show Mom how I mop the floor with my hair. Well, it's not really mopping. It's more like dusting. - What if you drop him on his head? - Then I guess I will have to mop. - Wonderful. Where's Alan? - He's in the kitchen. Walk this way. Master, your sexually ambivalent ex-wife is here. - I'm not ambivalent, I'm exploring. - Yes, mistress. - Thanks for bringing Jake over. - Well, I wanted to give you this anyway. - What is it? - It's the bill from my divorce lawyer. - You haven't been paying them. - Told you they'd notice. I also need you to look this over and sign it. And what is this? My lawyer recommended I take out a bigger life-insurance policy on you in case you should die and can't pay the alimony and legal fees. Why don't you have him frozen? Then you can use him to keep your drinks cold, too. And who's supposed to pay for this policy? You are. And please, try to be on time with the premiums. Boy, my shallow, empty lifestyle is looking pretty good right about now. Okay, as long as we're on the subject of lawyers and death, my lawyer recommended that I redraft my will. And you know what? If I die after you die, guess who gets custody of Jake? - Charlie. - Charlie? - Me? - What about my sister? - I never liked your sister. - Is this the sister I slept with? Shut up, Charlie. Alan, you can't be serious. He's immature, he drinks too much, he sleeps around, he is completely irresponsible. Yeah, you should've thought of that before you threw me out. Yeah. All right. You're obviously angry and trying to get even with me, but I am not gonna take the bait. I will see you on Sunday. Bye-bye. - Hey, man. Thanks. - For what? For trusting me to take care of Jake when you croak. I'm sorry. You didn't think I was serious, did you? I just said that to piss her off. Right. Good one. Hey! That's not fair! Why don't I get to keep the kid when you're dead? If I'm dead. And Judith would have to die before me for it to even be an issue. It's a contingency plan for a hypothetical worst-case scenario. I know it's a long shot, but I had the Marlins in the World Series. Don't tell me they don't come in. It never occurred to me that you'd want to be a full-time parent. This isn't about what I want. This is about what you want, - and you don't want me to have Jake. - What? Nothing. Why'd you say my name? Get over yourself, no one said your name. So what's wrong with me? Charlie, you're a great uncle. You're there for all the fun stuff. I don't think you're up to the hard work of being a full-time parent to Jake. - What? - Nothing. Nothing. So if not me, then who are you giving him to? I'm not giving him to anybody. He's not a 5-pound ham. You know what I mean. Who gets him in that scenario thing? - Cousin Jerry and his wife Faye. - Jerry and Faye? Why Jerry and Faye? They've got a good marriage, three kids, lots of dogs, a big backyard, and they live in a great school district. Yeah, but I'm your brother! - Charlie, it's not - And I live right here. You wouldn't have to ship him off to Corn Hole, Kansas. Coventry, Rhode Island. Who am I thinking of that lives in Kansas? I don't know, Dorothy and Toto? All right, Alan, let me ask you something. If I'm here, and Jake's in Rhode Island, who's gonna teach him all the things he needs to know? Jerry and Faye are both college professors. I'm talking about the important stuff. About life. Face it. When the time comes, are those two eggheads gonna step up and get your kid laid? - You're not helping your case, Charlie. - Fine, you've made your decision. Despite all I've been through with your son, my nephew, obviously I have no say in the matter. Where are you going? Alan, quite frankly, I'm a little hurt and a little disappointed, so I'm gonna go make myself a big glass of vodka and sit and think about things. Charlie, wait. Okay, how about this? If Judith dies and then I die, and then Jerry and Faye die, Jake will come and live with you. Yeah, like I'm gonna outlive Jerry and Faye the way I drink. - What do you say to Grandma? - Can I at least open it first? - Jake. - No, he's right. Wait and see if he likes it. - Now you can thank me. - Thank you. I'm kidding. No little boy wants a framed picture of his grandmommy. This is for your daddy. - What do you say, Dad? - Don't push me, Jake. That's my new photo for the Sunday real estate section. I thought maybe you'd like a color print of it for your office. Gee, Mom, we've already got the one of you swimming with dolphins. So you didn't bring me anything? Is that all grandmommy is good for, to bring you gifts? Of course I brought you something. There. Crayons? I'm 10. Well, it's not just crayons, sweetheart. It's also a dinosaur coloring book. - But I'm 10. - You want to trade? No, I'm good. - So, where's your brother? - Why? What'd he get? Nothing. I just want to make sure he knows why. He's in his room. He's been sulking all weekend. - Sulking? About what? - Well, it's the silliest thing. I just happened to mention that in the unlikely event that Judith should die, and I should die, that custody of Jake would go to - Custody of Jake would go to who? - Actually, it would be "whom. " - Alan, who gets Jake? - Now, see, that's grammatically correct. - Alan. - Jerry and Faye. Jerry and Faye who? - Your sister's son and his wife. - Them? You would bypass your own mother in favor of two potato farmers on Long Island? They're agriculture professors in Rhode Island. Really? Who am I thinking of who lives on Long Island? I have no idea. - Well, regardless, I am deeply insulted. - Come on, Mom. This is only if Judith and I both die, and we're not dying. - At least, not before you. - Now you're wishing me dead. - No, Mom. No, it's - Give me back my picture. No. Better you should look at it and feel shame. - Hey, want to play one-on-one? - Sure. Check it out. One, nothing. You know that Rhode Island isn't really an island? That's just a flat-out lie. Two, nothing. Hey, I've got to run some errands, so I'll be back in about an hour. You guys gonna be okay? Gee, Alan, you sure I can handle the responsibility? What if he wants to go to college or something? Charlie, please don't start. I'll see you later. - Hey! - Three, nothing. - That was a time-out. - You didn't call it. - Fine. Three, nothing. - You want a do-over? No, I don't want a do-over. Just bring it on. Not so easy when I'm paying attention, is it? Not so hard, either. - My head! - Oh, God. - You okay? - No. - All right, don't panic. - I'm not panicking. Good. You're gonna be fine. - We've just got to stop the bleeding. - I'm bleeding? - What? - Nothing. Just a little trickle. Here, take my shirt. Hold it up here. I'm sorry. Okay, let's get you up, nice and slow. Attaboy. I'll grab my car keys and we'll head to the hospital. A hospital? I don't want to go to a hospital! Did I say "hospital"? I meant Disneyland. How's it going there, pal? You still bleeding? - I don't know. - No, don't look. You just hang in there, we'll get you fixed up, and you'll be back home before you know it. Just as soon as we find the freaking hospital. - You don't know where the hospital is? - Of course I know where it is. I'm kind of hungry. Can we stop for a chili cheeseburger? You're hungry? How could you even think about food? What do you think about when you're hungry? Fair enough. We'll get you a chili cheeseburger at the hospital. - Will they have fries at the hospital? - They have everything. Some people go just for the food. Man, we'd better call your dad. Hello? - Why do you have your father's phone? - I don't know. - That's great. - Bye. Yes! An ambulance. Fifty-fifty shot he's going to a hospital. Hang on! I can't believe we beat the ambulance. Yeah, well, those things are just ice-cream trucks with blood bags. Hi, we need to see a doctor. - All right. Just fill this out and have a seat. - No, you don't understand. He hit his head, he's bleeding. - Did he lose consciousness? - No. I got a little woozy, though. Follow my finger. He's gonna be fine. That's it? He's gonna be fine? That's not a medical test, that's how you hypnotize a chicken. I'd like a chili cheeseburger and fries, please. You see, he's hallucinating. Can you please just get him in to a doctor? Well, you need to fill this out first. Come on, this is gonna take forever. Can't we do this later? Over dinner? Now you're hallucinating. Come on, buddy. All right. Let's see. Last name, Harper. First name, Jake. Ob? Jacob. I knew that. Middle name? - You don't know? - Of course I know. I want to see if you know. You fell on your head, dude. David. Jacob David. They went full Old Testament on you, didn't they? - Age, 10. Allergies? - I don't know. Is there anything you eat that makes you sick? I ate a worm once. No allergies. Have you had any of the following? - Measles? - I don't know. - Mumps? - I don't know. - Chicken pox? - Is that the one with the spots? - Yeah. - I don't know. All right. We're just gonna vote the straight "no" ticket. Family history? Your grandmother's always been a pain in the ass. Gonzales? - Right here! - I'm Gonzales. No, you're not. Right. He's Gonzales. - Okay, you're gonna feel a little sting. - Nobody said I had to get a shot! It's just to numb your skin so you won't feel the stitches. What are you gonna give me to not feel the shot? It's all right, pal. I'm right here with you. Big deal. I'm still gonna get a shot in my head. Come on, just hold my hand, look me in the eyes. Go ahead, Doc. - Hey, go easy on the kid! - No, you're squishing my hand! Sorry. But you didn't feel the shot, did you? - No. - You're welcome. Maybe you'd prefer to wait outside. I'd prefer a morphine drip and a sponge bath, but the kid needs me. - How many stitches am I gonna get? - I don't know, three or four. That's all? Scott Pressman got nine when his sister hit him with the Etch-A-Sketch. Help us out here, Doc. Okay, I'll go five, but one is purely decorative. Thank you. - Is this gonna leave a scar? - I'm afraid so. - No. - Yes! Okay, let's get started. Good, maybe that's your father. Hello. Hey, Judith. No, it's me, Charlie. What am I doing with Alan's phone? Why? Do you want custody of that, too? Come on, that's funny. I don't know. Maybe Alan and I accidentally switched phones. Why don't you try calling him on mine? I didn't pick it, but that's what it spells. Okay. Goodbye. Are you doing it? 'Cause I can't feel anything. - Yeah, that's the idea. - Can you see my brain? Sure, it's a big brain. You must be very smart. - Phone's ringing. - No, it's not. The doctor's just stimulating the phone-ring part of your brain. - Right, Doc? - Sure, why not? I ordered a chili cheeseburger out there. Will they know to bring it in? Come on, Mom. Those are two completely different scenarios. Hey. Cool hats. So, you're saying that because I didn't name you as Jake's guardian, you're switching your medical power of attorney from me to Charlie? - What's going on? - Hang on. If Mom's ever in a coma, you're the one who has to decide to pull the plug. Pull. All right, Mom, Charlie's onboard. Yeah, got to go. Hey, where have you guys been? You know, we went and got a couple of hamburgers, bought some hats. Ate the hamburgers, wearing the hats. Okay. - You're right, he bought it. - Bought what? Dude, you can forget about a life of crime. Oh, my God. What happened? We were playing basketball, and it got a little rough. - He fouled me. - You charged. - Did not. - Did, too! Hold on. - So you took him to the emergency room? - Yes. Where the cheeseburgers sucked, by the way. But he's okay? There's no concussion or anything? - No. - We saw my brain. No, we didn't. We didn't see any brains. Hey, why didn't you call me? There it is. Why do you have my cell phone? I don't know. All right. You sure you're okay? - Can I go watch TV? - Sure. I am really sorry, Alan. - Don't worry about it. He's fine. - Yeah, but I'm not. You were right. I obviously can't be trusted to take care of Jake. Believe me, the second you're in the ground, I'm sticking that kid on a plane to Rhode Island. Charlie, let me tell you something. You can't keep Jake from ever getting hurt. I mean, he's a boy. That's Getting hurt is like his job. Last summer, he actually fractured his ass doing a cannonball into the bathtub. All I care about is that he has somebody who loves him and who'll step up when it really counts. And that's what you did today. Yeah, I guess I did, didn't I? Yeah. And if, God forbid, something should ever happen to Judith and me, I would be very comfortable knowing that you were looking after my son. Dead, but comfortable. Does this mean you're putting me in the will? - Yeah. - Wow. Thanks, man. That means a lot. - Just do me a favor, all right? - What's that? Don't die. - That's a very cute hat. - Thank you. It makes my hair sweat. Oh, my God! What happened to your head? I got five stitches. There was blood everywhere. - Why didn't anyone tell me? - I just did. - Can we stop for pizza? - I can't believe this. I'm going to have a little talk with your father. Hello? English   





                    			- But I don't want to go to summer camp. - Are you kidding? You'll have a great time. Look at this one. It's a computer camp with a theater program. Ethernet by day, No, no, Nanette by night. I don't want to go to camp. If the kid doesn't want to go, don't make him go. - Yeah. - He's 10, he's old enough to work. What? When I was your age, I spent my summers hosing tarantulas off bananas in the back of my stepfather's truck. - What's going on? - I'm going to camp. Okay. Morning, all. Beautiful day. - You're in a good mood. - Well, I suppose I am. I got a little e-mail this morning from an ex-girlfriend, who says she needs to "see" me. No kidding. I wonder if she's "knocked up. " Nobody's knocked up. I haven't heard from her in five years. So she's bringing you a 4-year-old. Believe me, nobody's bringing anything. - Remember Jill? - Jill the slob? Yeah, but do you remember how hot she was? Sure, she was a tight unit, but she left dirty dishes everywhere. Swear to God, this broad left half eaten casseroles in the bathtub. So? With a body like that she could drink out of the toilet if she wanted to. Wait a minute. Isn't she the one who dumped you? Somebody dumped Charlie? Broke his little black heart. It was pathetic. She didn't dump me. She had personal problems and moved to Europe to, you know, find herself. - Berta? - He wept. I did not. I felt the appropriate amount of sadness for a good relationship that had run its course. I had to carry him to bed three nights in a row. I was perfectly happy sleeping under the deck. You bring her home, you clean up after. Thank God you never get any. - What can I get for you? - White wine, please. Maybe a Chablis. You know, make it a beer. Light beer. Just a beer. Another one? Might as well. Looks like I'm getting stood up. Chicks, huh? Maybe she's got a good reason. I tell you what, if it were any other woman, I'd have been out of here an hour ago. - Really? - Oh, yeah. This girl? This girl's something different. How so? Well, did you ever go out with somebody who's not only great in bed but also like a really cool friend? Yeah. Once. In fact, now that I think about it, the friendship was the best part of our relationship. No kidding? Yeah. The sex was a little weird. We would like wrestle to get on top. She would actually get angry if she wasn't up there. Maybe she had a good reason. Maybe. Charlie, look at me. - How do you know my name? - It's me. Me who? No. Yes. Jill? Bill. No. We're gonna need two shots of tequila. - That's okay, I don't want to - They're not for you. This girl you're waiting for really must be something. Just serve the hooch and mind your own business. - Listen, Charlie, I know - Hang on. Okay, go. I know this comes as a shock to you. Please, if I had a nickel for every time a girl dumped me and disappeared for five years and came back as a guy, I'd have a nickel. Keep them coming. I think I owe you an explanation. Who pays the nickel, by the way? Is it you or just out of some general fund? Yeah? Remember, when we broke up and I said, "It's not you, it's me"? Yes. And I believe you now. I was so mixed up and unhappy as a woman: So? I know lots of mixed up, unhappy women. They go shopping and eat ice cream. Did you even try that? I tried everything, but the truth is, I was always a man trapped in a woman's body. No, I'm not buying this. If you were really a man back then, you would've jumped at that three-way with the cocktail waitress in Carmel. I begged you. - You haven't changed. - I wish I could say the same. Charlie, how could I have explained it to you back then? I couldn't even explain it to myself. Okay, now you've explained. Thank you. Nice to see you again. Good luck with the penis. Wait. A few minutes ago you said I was a really cool friend. Yeah. Well, I'm back in LA and I'm kind of starting a new life. - And I could really use a friend. - Oh, boy. It's just You know, I'm completely alone, and I'm really scared. Jeez. - It's gonna be okay, Jill. - Bill. Yeah, Bill, whatever. It's okay. I'm still your friend. Charlie, you're the best. I wish I could've loved you the way you deserve to be loved. Thanks for the ride, Bill. You're a good friend. - You called me Bill. - That's your name, lady. Just like old times, huh? Drag your drunk ass home, take you upstairs, get you undressed and Alan. You never met my brother, Alan, did you? No, I never met anyone in your family, Charlie. Yeah, different rules now. Bill, this is my brother Alan. Alan, this is my old friend, Bill. - Nice to meet you, Bill. - Same here. I thought you were gonna hook up with that girlfriend who wanted to "see" you. Right. Turns out she changed her "mind. " Anyway, I ran into my old friend, Bill, here. So, stood up by Jill, ran into Bill. That's funny. You have a sick sense of humor, Alan. The house is clean, I'm going home now. I'll pick that up on Monday. I'm sorry, that's mine. Hi. Hi. Okay, I'm out of here. So, Bill, you from around here? I was, but I moved away for a couple years. I'm planning on moving back and buying a place. Hello. Evelyn Harper, Evelyn Harper Real Estate. - Yeah, Mom's here. - No problem, I'm drunk. I'm Bill Shraeder. I'm a friend of Charlie's. No need to apologize. So, are you interested in renting or buying? - Buying. - Excellent. Price range? - I'm flexible. - I'll bet you are. - But I was talking money. - So was I. Sexy and liquid. I like that in a man. - Nice guy. Poker buddy? - Used to. And don't call me "buddy. " There it is. Thank you so much for showing me the condos, Evelyn. Thank you for dinner, Bill. Thank you for dessert. Shall we go to my place for coffee and cigars? - I don't smoke. - You will when I'm done with you. Oh, my God. He's like half her age. Yeah. That's the problem. I'm trying, Charlie. I'm trying to be open-minded. But our mom with a guy who's younger than us, it's just freaking me out. Trust me, Alan. Very soon you're gonna be looking back on this moment with fond nostalgia. - What do you mean? - Look. - Who's this? - This is Jill. The woman who dumped you? Get over that. Nobody dumped me. All right, I'm sorry. Why are we looking at Jill? - Just look at it. - Okay. She's cute. Very tall. Broad shoulders. Holy mother of God! Welcome to the Matrix. - So Jill is - Yep. - And you and Jill used to - Every chance we got. - And Mom is - At this very moment. Holy mother of God! What are you guys yelling about? - Go to bed. - Go to bed. - Do you realize what this means? - Yes. I slept with a woman who wanted to be a man. Or, I slept with a man in a woman's body. Or, and this is my new favorite, and the title of my autobiography, my mom and I slept with the same dude. Excuse me, could we just table that for now and discuss how this impacts on our mother? Why? The damage has been done. All that's left to do now is drink until the part of the brain that creates mental pictures is dead. Charlie, stay with me. Do you think I'm gay? For God's sake, Charlie, this is not about you. I like musical theater. Maybe all these years I've been pathologically chasing women because I've been overcompensating. You know, I've often thought that. What? I'm agreeing with you. What do you want to hear? I want you to tell me that there is no chance that either of us will ever have to call a woman I slept with "Daddy. " Jill the slob. Gadzooks! - Morning. - Morning. So, how was your weekend? - Fine. - Okay. Nothing exciting happening in your world, Charlie? - Like what? - I don't know. Go to a fun party? See a great movie? Run into an old flame with a new wick? What are the odds? One brother turns them gay, and the other turns them guy. If you don't mind, Berta, I'd rather not talk about it. Okay. I'll fix you something to eat. How about a sausage link and a couple eggs? Hello? Anybody home? Oh, no. Charlie, I need to talk to you about your friend, Bill. - Oh, boy. - Oh, boy. You know, I'd really rather not discuss this in front of the help. - Berta, could you give us some privacy? - Hell, no. - Sorry. - Okay. Bill and I shared something very special this weekend. I realize that might be awkward for you, so I thought I'd come by to discuss it. That's nice, Mom. Isn't that nice, Alan? You're the expert, Charlie. Is it too early to start drinking? What's that supposed to mean? Mom, how much do you know about Bill? Charlie, I have no doubt that you two shared some sordid adventures together, but that's the past. The only thing that matters to me now is that Bill is a handsome, sensitive, wonderful man. Excuse me? Nothing. I'm just happy to be here. Frankly, Mom, I'm a little uncomfortable with this. A little? I think I'm having a stroke. I knew it. You hypocrites. It's perfectly all right for you to date younger women. But when a mature woman gets involved with a younger man, somehow it's scandalous and immoral. - No, Mom, it's not the age. - Well, what then? Because he's your friend? I didn't object when you dated that friend of mine. - You what? - One time. I was 19 and she was a very doable 42. And if you heard how she talked about you, you wouldn't call her a friend. I've heard enough. I'm going to continue to see Bill, and if you don't like it, that's just too bad. Wait, Mom, I thought you came here so that we could discuss it. Please, I came here to brag. I just needed an opening line. - Wow, she doesn't know. - Someone's going to have to tell her. - Charlie? - What? I'll clean your house free for a month if you let me do it. Come on, it is a little funny. When we were dating you never wanted me to meet your mom. All right, maybe not so much funny as ironic. - Look, Jill. Bill. - You're angry with me. Not angry. Not thrilled. Charlie, I never planned for this to happen. I mean, your mom and I just hit it off. She beautiful, intelligent, self-assured, and she's just exploding with this raw sexuality. No, listen, fella, I don't know what they told you in orientation, but, Rule Number 1, when a guy talks like that about another guy's mom, he's likely to get his ass kicked. Come on, Charlie, please don't get all macho on me. You couldn't take me when I was a girl. Don't change the subject. We're talking about you and my mother. Why haven't you told her? - Told her what? - That you're lactose intolerant. What do you think? - Stop yelling at me. - I'm not yelling at you! Yes, you are! Okay, I'm sorry. Look, you need to understand that no matter how much I hate my mother, I love my mother, and I don't want to see her get hurt. So, you got to tell her before she finds out the hard way. Or whatever way she finds out. But what if she rejects me? Welcome to the rodeo, Calamity Jane. You want to be a real man? Grab hold of those store-bought balls and just tell the truth. Yeah, you're right. We still friends? Yeah. Sure. I'm glad. They're made out of Teflon, you know. Okay, Rule Number 2 What'd I miss? Nothing. I don't think he's told her yet. What are you doing here? You finished cleaning hours ago. I took a nap in the laundry room so I'd be fresh for the big show. Okay, I think he's going for it. - Wow, that went surprisingly well. - Damn. Wait a minute, what's he doing? There you go. See you tomorrow. Okay, we'll make a list. The pros and cons of continuing your relationship with Bill. - Mom? - Well, he certainly understands women. Okay, that's a pro. He used to be a woman. I'll put con. He slept with Charlie when he was a woman. Pro. No, wait, con. Definitely con. - He knows what I like in bed. - He knows what I like in bed. We'll call that a wash. - What's the score? - It's about even. He's gorgeous. He can afford beach-front property and he's got a trunk full of fabulous shoes that fit me perfectly. Don't wait up, Mommy's got a date. English   





                    			Okay, how about this? If you let me have Jake this Easter, you can have him the Fourth of July and Labor Day. No. That doesn't work for me at all. How about I give you all the Jewish holidays? When did we become Jewish, Alan? It's still holidays. Your brother's a schmuck. What are they arguing about now? It's actually kind of ironic. They're arguing about who gets you on what days. That is ironic. You know what "ironic" means? No, but I trust you. What's ironic is while they're arguing about who gets you, I get you. And you know what? It's not such a big deal. No offense, but let's face it, you're 10. I can't take you to Vegas, we can't double-date. And when was the last time you picked up a check, you mooch? I'm almost 11. Okay, I think we've got it. I get him Thanksgiving, you get him Halloween. You get him Christmas Eve, I get him Christmas Day. - I get him Yom Kippur. - And I get Hanukkah. Hey, guys, I just found out. Jake's birthday is, like, in a week. Shouldn't we make plans? You're right, he's a schmuck. What? We know when his birthday is, Charlie. We were there. But only one of us got a needle shoved in their spine. You begged for that. Anyway, you, me, and Mom are taking Jake to a show at the Magic Castle. You invited Mom? You want to tell her she can't come to her grandchild's birthday? 'Cause believe me, I tried. Oh, man. Look at the bright side. Maybe we can bribe one of the magicians to get her sawed in half. Or better still, thrown in a wood chipper. Judith and her sister are going to join us as well. Which sister, the brunette or the blonde? The brunette. Why? Just curious. I never slept with the blonde. And you're not gonna sleep with the brunette again, either. Relax, that was 12 years ago. Well, thank you. Let's just wait till we get a look at her now. Happy birthday! A magic set? Awesome. How lovely. Perhaps he'll grow up to be a carny. It includes 14 different illusions that will amaze and astound your friends. But, of course, your friends may be smarter than mine. - Cool! - Have fun at the Magic Castle. Aren't you coming with us? I wish I could, but I gotta go to some clown's wedding. I'll try and come back for cake, okay? - Thanks a lot, Rose. - You're welcome. Bye, Evelyn. Bye-bye. Thank you so much. Poor soul. I'm sure she meant well. Now. Open Grandmommy's present. - Clothes? - Happy birthday. Thanks a lot, but clothes? Not clothes, darling. It's Calvin Klein. No, it's clothes. Believe me, sweetheart, the girls are gonna love you in this. What girls? All right, the other boys will be envious. The other boys will beat me up. Well, there's just no pleasing you, is there? Almost ready? Judith and Liz will be here soon. Liz. Thank you. Boy, that would have been embarrassing. Charlie, please don't make a bad situation worse. Judith and Liz have been at each other's throats for years. - Why's that? - I don't know. Maybe it's because Liz was always more popular. Maybe because Judith was smarter. Maybe, and this is just a theory on my part, it had something to do with the fact that Liz did my brother in the coatroom at our wedding reception. Well, no secret why she was popular. At our wedding reception, Charlie. In the coatroom. You were louder than the band. Hey, you make it sound so sleazy. I'm sorry. Class it up for me. Okay, to begin with, we were on a mink coat. Goodbye. And I was wearing a tuxedo. It's an 11-year-old's birthday party. You could've at least put on a bra. Some of us don't need bras. Some of us have had husbands and children. I've had husbands. And please, would you behave yourself with Charlie? - What do you mean? - I mean, I don't want a repeat of what happened in the coatroom at my wedding reception. That was Charlie? Hey, soul sisters. Come on in. Hello, Alan. Alan, you look fantastic. I guess single life really agrees with you. You know, doing okay. Starting over, landed on my feet. Like a cat. Hey, Mom. Hey, sweetie. Hi. - Hey, Aunt Liz. - There's my favorite nephew. Happy birthday, sweetie. It isn't clothes, is it? This is a surprise. Hello, Evelyn. It's not a surprise. I told her. You're looking very well. Slimming down nicely. Thanks. I recently dropped 160 pounds. I take Pilates. Hey, everybody. Uncle Charlie, look what Aunt Liz got me. Awesome. I don't suppose you thought to buy him a safety helmet. You ride with Aunt Liz, you take your chances. Right, Liz? This guy? Are you sure? - Alan? - Yeah, Mom. Now that we've seen the dove disappear up the greasy man's sleeve, how about we stop for a little drinkie-poo? Mom, it's still Jake's birthday. We're going home for cake. Okay. But first a drinkie-poo. Don't you think you had enough to drink at the magic show? Excuse me, but some of us deal with our boredom and depression the old-fashioned, non-prescription way. - That's telling her, Evelyn. - Now, see. This one gets me. Alan, you married the wrong sister. Why don't you lie down back there, take a little nap? Okey-dokey. How can you not remember the coatroom? I remember the coatroom. I just don't remember you. How can you not remember me? Do you remember everyone you've had sex with? Of course not. But come on, we're practically family. Okay, Dad, see this ring? It's made of one unbroken piece of stainless steel. I can see that. And this one is just the same. I swear. - I believe you. - Now watch. One, two, three. Hold on. One, two, three. Ironic. Wait, don't look. Alan, how are those magic fingers of yours? I'm sorry? I have this kink in my back and I was hoping you could give me one of your fantastic adjustments when we get home. Sure, I suppose. Thank you. I can't wait. Wait a minute. His magic fingers you remember? Ta-da! This is really weird. Yeah. How could she not remember me? - What are you talking about? - What are you talking about? Judith's sister's hitting on me. She's not hitting on you. She's hitting on her sister's ex-husband. But that's me. Stop taking it personally. You said it yourself. They've been going at each other for years. And let's examine the current situation. Nothing Liz does with me is gonna make Judith any madder. I've already flown my mission. The only play she has left is to sleep with you. Well, that's not gonna happen. Well, certainly not with that attitude. Now, come on, you can't say you've never thought about it. Liz? No. Alan. Look me in the eye. Okay, I'm looking. Tell me you've never thought about being with Liz. You know, you have very curly eyelashes. - Answer the question. - Come on, Charlie. - It's my ex-wife's sister. - Exactly. Sisters are like the Holy Grail of recreational sex. Technically, it'd be twins, but that's such a biological oddity, it's hardly worth pursuing. Dad, pick a card. Okay. Seven of diamonds? No. Eight of spades? No. - Ace of clubs? - No. Is it black or red? We'll just have the cake, and then we'll go. You can go if you want. I'll have Alan drive me home after he adjusts me. Why are you doing this? Doing what? Alan. - You want him back, don't you? - No, I don't want him back. Then why do you care what I do with him? If you're determined to do something stupid today, I'd actually prefer you do Charlie. So would Charlie, but we can't always get what we want. Wow! That's a lot of candles. He's still 11, right? You want to deal with the candles? Is that what you want? - No, I'm fine. - So, Alan. When do you think you'll be ready for me? Maybe after the cake. - Okay. - Okay. You just say the word, and we'll do it. In high school, the word was "hello. " Don't pretend you don't know what she's doing. Her back hurts, Judith. She wants an adjustment. She doesn't want an adjustment. And why do you think her back hurts in the first place? So, she does need an adjustment. I forbid you to have anything to do with my sister. Really? You forbid me? I've got news for you. We're not married anymore. You don't get to forbid me. - I'm warning you. - What warning? - What happened to forbidding? - Just listen to me. If you lay one magic little finger on Liz, - you and I will have a big problem. - What are you gonna do? Divorce me? Marry me again and then divorce me? You want to see a trick? - Sure. - Yeah, sure, honey. "Good evening, sir or madame. "Have we ever met before?" So, Liz. The wedding reception, the coatroom. Did I ever say thank you? I don't really remember, Charlie. Well, let me just say, long overdue then, thank you. Okay. And not just for the one time. Over the years, I've actually used the mental picture of that night as lighter fluid when I'm, you know, barbecuing alone. Hey, come on, that's a compliment. - Hey, Grandma? - What? Now, madame, keep your eye on the magic ball. Watch closely. No, wait. Okay, now I'll take the magic ball from my left hand and put it into my right. See? Now I'll throw the magic ball back into the cup. You think it's under the cup? Do I think what's under the cup? The magic ball. Very good, dear. Good Lord, how long have I been asleep? Make a wish, buddy. I've already made my wish. - Don't you dare. - Now we're daring? Warning, forbidding, and daring? I want to talk to you. - Are you hearing this? - I'm trying. - What is your problem? - You are my problem. - Why are they fighting? - They're not fighting. They're discussing. I'm a child of divorce, Dad. I know the difference. - You're a selfish, hateful person. - Maybe you should go to your room. - It's my birthday. - Ironic, huh? Hi, everybody. Sorry I'm late. Actually, you're right on time. Here's $50. Take Jake to the arcade, and don't come back till you're out of quarters. Okay. Come on, Jake. Cool. So, how was the wedding? It was a circus. Bye, honey. Have fun. You were always a cheap slut and you haven't changed. I was the slut? Miss Technically-I'm-Still-A-Virgin. Girls, that's no way to talk. Ever since we were kids, anytime I loved something, you took it away from me. But you will not take away my ex-husband. - You love me? - What? No! I'm trying to make a point here. Judith, if I wanted Alan, I could've had him a long time ago. What the hell does that mean? - You never told her? - Told me what? Well, I mean, it's no big deal. Really. It's just that before I asked you out, I asked Liz out. You lied to me? If I had said yes, you never would have dated him. So, I was your second choice? No. Chronologically, yes. But in my heart, you were always first. But in reality, you were second. And you never told me this? Well, you can kind of see why. You know, this wouldn't have happened if you were twins. Okay. Fine. You always wanted Liz? Go ahead, here's your chance. Give her your little adjustment. While you're having a good time with my sister, I'll have a good time with your brother. Beg pardon? Don't be coy with me. You know we've always had sexual tension between us. Really? I thought it was just regular tension. Come on, I've seen you looking at my chest. You looked at my wife's chest? Hey, I'm a guy. I will rock his world, Alan, I swear. - You're bluffing. - Am I? Watch me. - Come on, Charlie. - Alan? - She's bluffing, Charlie. - Are you sure? Trust me, she hates you. Trust me. That doesn't always stop them. Come on, Alan, I'll show you where it hurts. Clear something up for me. Chiropractic adjustment, that's just a euphemism? - Right. - So, we're really gonna do this? Wow, I thought we were bluffing. - Okay, we were bluffing. - Us, too. My God, that clown has no legs! Okay, you see the coin? You're supposed to say, "Have we ever met before?" Just watch the trick, okay? We'll work on the patter later. You see the coin? Now, I grab it with this hand and I blow, and it's gone. Where do you think it is? It's right here. How the hell did you do that? Ironic, huh? English   





                    			Hey, Judith. There's the rock star. Ready for a fun weekend? Leave me alone. Musicians. Alan, that child is driving me insane. Like father like son, huh? Really, that bad? He's been sullen and uncooperative for days. I think he needs to see someone. What, you mean like a shrink? No, Alan, I mean like a blacksmith. This is clearly a reaction to our divorce. He's not processing his emotions in a healthy way, and I think therapy could help unblock him. - Where did you get that? - From my therapist. Who's working wonders with you. Excuse me? Who's working wonders with you. All he does is sit in his room and play that damn thing. He's isolating, Alan. That doesn't mean he needs to see a therapist. He's a normal 11-year-old kid who happens to be a little grumpy. And I'm a normal 35-year-old mother who is running out of patience. And by patience I mean Prozac. Wait a minute. You can't still be 35, because He's getting pretty good at that. Yeah, well get used to it. Charlie, what are you doing? Smoke on the Water. Okay. It's not cute anymore. Make him stop. You're the one who bought him the guitar, Charlie. The bed is vibrating so much up there I'm no longer necessary. Well, I'm sorry my son's interrupted your afternoon debauchery, but I think he's upset about something. - What's he upset about? - I don't know. I was just giving him a little space before I talked to him. You want me to talk to him? Sure, and I'll finish for you upstairs. This is a father's job. Tell him I just need, like, 20 minutes. Can I come in? It really sounds like you've got your mojo working. But let's try to turn it down now, okay? What'd you do that for? Because I love you, and I don't want that to change. So how was your week? Okay. Anything I need to know? - Anything bothering you? - No. You sure? 'Cause it seems like something's bothering you. Okay, you wanna know what's bothering me? Yeah. People keep on asking me what's bothering me. - Okay. I won't ask. - Good. - You know, when I was your age - Oh, man! Okay, forget that. - Problems at school? - No. - Problems with Mom? - No. Because I understand there's some things a guy doesn't want to - talk with his mom about. - Like what? Well, you know, girl problems, or somebody's picking on you. Or you're the only guy in gym class without hair on his testicles. She sobered up on you, huh? No, I'm just being a good host. And, yeah, a little bit. - Man. - Did you figure out what his problem is? No, but we determined mine was late-onset puberty. You were a Mexican hairless, weren't you? Did you check to see if he's constipated? His mother and I are going through a divorce, and there's a lot of emotions he hasn't processed. Maybe so, but there's also a lot of string cheese he hasn't processed. You know, Judith thinks he needs to see a therapist. Why, 'cause it's working so good for her? Charlie, that's uncalled for. Come on. The kid's problem is he's 11. He can't drive, he can't drink, and his mother picks out all his clothes. Be thankful he's not in the garage biting the heads off of chickens. But this isn't like him. Trust your first instinct. Just give him a little space, and probably by this time tomorrow I will have killed him. Not bad. But why don't you try fretting the "E" and the "A" string together? I like my way. Cool. What did you do that for? Look, I'm really happy you've taken up an instrument, and I'll be even happier when you learn an actual song. But right now, let's just take a little pause for the cause. What do you want? Nothing. I just thought we could hang out. A couple of musicians taking five. Just chilling. Nothing's bothering me. That's cool. I'm not trying to harsh your mellow. I know there are certain things a guy doesn't want to talk to his parents about. - Like what? - I don't know. Peer pressure. Bullies. Skipping class to drive to Tijuana with the school nurse. I'm telling you, my youngest once ate a whole can of Play-Doh. Stopped her up for two weeks. Berta, please. Finally, pooped out an ashtray. That's the day I quit smoking. Any luck? The little snothead kicked me out of his room. Welcome to the club. Yeah, but I'm the cool uncle. And I'm the uncool dad? Don't get defensive. You did the best you could. That kid has nothing to complain about. He's never been spanked, he's never even been yelled at. And even while my marriage was collapsing, he always came first. Well, I'm glad you're not defensive. He has a great life. He gets everything he wants, I deny him nothing. Oh, my God, what have I done to my son? Alan, I was kidding. You're a terrific father. - You think so? - Yes, I do. You're right. I'm always too quick to blame myself. - Yes, you are. - It's his mother's fault. Attaboy! Would you like me to make you a snack, Jake? I'm not hungry. You sure? We've got some pizza left from dinner. Alan, ease up. He said he's not hungry. You'll eat when you want to, right? Would you please not talk? I'm trying to watch. This show is stupid. You're right. Here. You pick something. Thanks. Cool uncle. Stupid. Stupid. Boring. Stupid. Seen it. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. Really stupid. Stupid. Dumb. Stupid. All right! Pick a stupid show and live with it. - Forget it, I'll just go to my room. - Jake, wait. Nice going, cool uncle. Now it's my fault? Let me tell you something, between you and your whacko wife, I'm an oasis of normality around here. Are you ever gonna come back upstairs? I'm still an oasis. Morning. Morning. Did your guest leave? No, she's sleeping in. Please do not let me forget again. Perhaps you should put a Post-it Note on your penis. Yeah, but then I'd have to take down the sign for the yard sale. Buddy, I made silver dollar pancakes. I'm not hungry. - Come on, they're your favorite. - I said no. You know what I was thinking? Maybe later, we could have a jam session. You on guitar, me on piano. I'd rather watch cartoons. - What is your problem? - Charlie, calm down. I'm sorry, but when I was his age, I had to walk five blocks in the rain to have a jam session. Yeah, well, yelling at him isn't gonna help. I was thinking that maybe the three of us could go out and do something fun today. You want fun? Let's take him to the Rose Bowl Swap Meet and see what we can get for him. Or, we could be patient and maybe eventually he'll tell us what's bothering him. Where's my grandson? Or, we could scare it out of him. Granted, I don't know what it's like to be an 11-year-old boy, but I do know one thing, sweetheart. You have no idea what real unhappiness is. Real unhappiness is being totally ignored by the very people you gave birth to. Real unhappiness is when you're recovering from liposuction and your only grandson doesn't even send you a get-well card. And FYI, I only had that surgery so you wouldn't have a grandmommy with matronly upper arms. Well, if he didn't need a shrink before, he needs one now. I'm telling you, you're spoiling the kid. I didn't have a shrink when I was Jake's age, and my childhood was twice as screwed up as his. I mean, you're a little cuckoo, Judith. But compared to our mother, you're like a fart in a hurricane. Mom never took you to see Dr. Demerest? - You got to see a shrink? - Just a couple of times. For the night terrors, agoraphobia, and bed-wetting. Did it work? I can pee outside in the dark. You be the judge. You know, Charlie, if you think I'm cuckoo, simply because I want to help my child express his feelings, well, then I think you have a big problem. So, Jake. How you liking that bean bag chair, huh? - You comfy? - It's okay. 'Cause we could sit in the little chairs. You know, sometimes I like to sit in a little chair. Makes me feel like a giant. Hello, Jake. Well, I can barely see you from up here. Do you sometimes feel like a small, insignificant person in a world full of giants? Not really. Well, maybe that's just me. So anyhow, I was hoping we could talk for a little bit. Draw some pictures, maybe play some games. Do you like puppets? Not really. Neither do I. But sometimes they help when I'm in a bad mood! I hope she gets him to talk about the divorce. Yeah, it's a traumatic thing to see his father kicked out of his house. It wasn't exactly healthy for him to see the life being sucked out of his mother. Excuse me. But that was going on for years, and he was still a happy little boy. "He stuck in his thumb and pulled out a blank. " Plum, right? It would be nice if you took a little responsibility for Jake's problems. She's right, Charlie. - Me? What did I do? - You taught him how to gamble. You brought strange women into the house. You taught him how to curse in Italian. Your drinking sets a bad example. Let's get one thing straight. I taught him how to curse in Spanish. Okay. Well, Jake and I had a wonderful talk. And now I'd like to speak with the grownups. Aren't you coming in, Charlie? No, I'm still trying to find the toothbrush in the tree here. Is this Uncle Charlie? Well, I definitely want to talk with Uncle Charlie. Thanks a lot! No, please, make yourselves comfortable. Okay, well, Jake and I had a very nice little talk. I invited him to share his feelings with me in a confidential, non-threatening context. And after hearing everything he had to say, I must tell you very frankly Who am I kidding, I got nothing. That's it? $150 an hour for "I got nothing"? It's $175. But that's not really the point now, is it? - What did he tell you? - He claims nothing's bothering him. He claims there's nothing wrong, but when I probed just a little bit, he told me to besa mi culo. You see? Spanish. I hope you're proud of yourself, Charlie. He's not a sulky little jerk-wad 'cause he learned a second language. - See what my son's been living with? - Only because she threw me out. What? I have a right to be happy. Speaking of which, did I leave that girl at the house? Shut up, Charlie. - Don't tell me to shut up. - Calm down. - I don't even know what he's doing here. - I'm trying to keep your kid from turning into a neurotic basket case like my brother. Maybe then, he won't marry a messed up woman. I'm screwed up because you're a lousy brother. - My God, your whole family's insane. - Hold on, people! Even cows know words can hurt. Jake, you know that even though your mother and I bicker sometimes, we will always love you, no matter what. I know. And, honey, you also need to know that our splitting up - had absolutely nothing to do with you. - I know. It's just that Mommy has a right to be happy. Yeah, he knows. And whatever's bothering you, you know I had nothing to do with it, right? - Yeah. - See? Can I go to bed now? Now? Jake, it's only 7:00. I'm tired. All right, honey. I'll come tuck you in before I leave. - Okay, that's a bad sign. - It's a symptom of clinical depression. You would know. Please, if my kids had gone to bed at 7:00 I'd have dipped myself in gravy and danced naked on the rooftops. She does make a hell of a gravy. - Morning, Uncle Charlie. - Morning. Morning, Dad. Morning, Berta. - Morning. - Morning. So, Dad, what are we gonna do today? I don't know. What would you like to do? I don't know, something fun. Maybe we could jam, Uncle Charlie. Great. Dad, can I eat my cereal down by the TV? - Sure. - Thanks. What happened to him? If I didn't know better, I'd swear he got laid last night. I hope you don't mind, but I talked to him before he went to sleep last night. What did you say? I said, drink this bottle of prune juice. You feed him nothing but pizza and pancakes. It's a wonder his eyeballs are still in their sockets. Wait a minute. Oh, man. Not again. Jake Harper. Unplugged. English   





                    			These divorce lawyers have a good business, don't they? Yeah, in the same way locusts have a good business. Smells good. So does the coffee. Charlie, stop sniffing the paralegals. Look, I am paying my attorney by the hour, so just speak when spoken to and otherwise, you know, just shut up. If you'd listened to me in the first place, you wouldn't be in this mess. I'm the one who told you not to marry her. You're also the one who told me that if I jumped off the garage roof with a bath towel tied around my neck, I could fly to school. The one time you listened to me. Let me tell you another thing. If I hadn't married Judith, there'd be no Jake. I didn't say you couldn't knock her up. Okay, let's get started. - Wow! - No. No wowing. No sniffing, no wowing. - Laura Lang. - Charlie Harper. - Didn't you used to date Superman? - That's Lana Lang. She was Superboy's girlfriend. And guys have been using that tired old line on me since the fifth grade. Did it ever work? - Let's just get down to business, okay? - Okay. Didn't the Titanic bang into her? Okay, Mr. Harper, the reason I wanted to see you is because your brother is involved in a divorce action where the custody of his son might become an issue. Really? Why? Because Jake stays with his father part-time, his father lives with you, and in the words of his mother, you are, hang on, I want to get this right. Here it is, "A sleaze ball. " Yeah. So? So she might try to take Jake out of your home. Why? It's a beautiful home. You should really come see it some evening. It's in Malibu. Right on the beach. My point is, if Mrs. Harper decides to make an issue out of your lifestyle we need to be prepared. What's wrong with my lifestyle? No, we are not going down that road at $300 an hour. Relax, Alan. I'm going to need to know every possible thing they can use against us. - Every skeleton in your closet. - Oh, boy. So what, you want to know about my sex life? Your sex life, your drinking, your gambling, partying. On the beach. Mr. Harper. I'm sorry. But isn't that kind of an invasion of my privacy? It is, and I apologize for that. But I handle a lot of divorces, and believe me, they can get nasty. Look, I've got to be in court. So why don't you give this some thought, and when you gather the information we need, give me a call. Okay. Starting from now and working backward, I've slept with my brother's attorney So, Laura, let me ask you something. The other day in your office, you didn't seem to like me much. I was just wondering what caused you to drive over here, you know, mostly naked? Charlie, I don't have to like you to want you. Right on. For the record, I don't like you much either. Right on. Another question. Seeing as how you're my brother's lawyer and all, is what we're doing here, what's the word, unethical? Oh, God, yes. Right on. Listen, Charlie. I totally get who you are. You date lots of women, you're a player. - That's fine. I don't care. - You are very special. I just have one little request. You can pretty much have anything you want right now. If your brother found out about us, he could sue me for malpractice. I'm taking a big risk here. - Man, this just keeps getting hotter. - But I need you to do something for me. When I call you, when I want you, you've got to be there. Okay. Let's practice. Hello? - Hey, Laura. What's up? - Now. Right on. - Hello? Charlie? - No. Sorry, but I'm gonna have to speed this up. Charlie, relax. Just go downstairs and distract him while I sneak out. - You're going to leave? - I'm done. No cuddling, no sharing feelings? - I think I'm starting to like you. - Save the sweet talk. Just remember our deal. You know, it suddenly occurs to me, I'm usually the one sneaking out when the man gets home. Charlie, go. I thought it was a fun fact. - Hi, Uncle Charlie. - Hey, buddy. - You're here early. - Teacher's conference, half day. - Where you going? - Looking for my Gameboy. Forget your Gameboy. It's a beautiful day. Go watch TV. I don't want to watch TV. I want to play my Gameboy, and it's in your room. The parental code that unlocks the pay channels is one-two-three-four. One-two-three-four. I should have known. I'm sorry. Did I interrupt your late-morning nap, or your early-afternoon nap? I don't nap. I recharge. - Can I get you a beer? - Sure, thanks. Come on. Hang on. Alan Harper for Laura Lang, please. - What are you doing? - I'm calling my lawyer. Why? I thought we were going to have a beer. Judith is demanding half of my book collection. Oh, man. - Sounds like you need a beer. - They are rare first editions, Charlie. Very valuable. Okay, you don't need to get your lawyer involved. You still got your old garage door clicker, right? - Yeah. - So let Judith have the books. Then one night, maybe someone goes and gets them back. Wonderful. Breaking and entering. - It's not breaking if you have the clicker. - More good advice. And it's free. - So hang up, and let's get that beer. - Sure, I'll hold. Yeah, they're patching me through to her cell phone. What's that? That is coincidentally my cell phone. - Excuse me. - Hi, Alan. - Don't answer. - What's up? - What are you doing? - Hang on, Alan. I'm making a living, Charlie. I thought you were worried about malpractice. I'm more worried about billable hours. Can you prove you acquired the books in question prior to the marriage? - Charlie? - Coming! - Why are you shushing me? Hang on. - What? - I'm on the phone with Laura. - Say hi for me. - Give it up, Charlie. She doesn't like you. - True. You'll testify that I bought all my first edition books before I got married, right? - Did you? - No. - Then I'm your man. - I can prove it. Charlie's my witness. - What happened to the TV? - There's nothing dirty on. - I'm going to go play my Gameboy. - No. Wait right here. I'll get it for you. Of course he's credible. I don't know, Alan. If the right lawyer gets their hands on him, they could really make him sweat. Yeah, very funny. Have you seen a Gameboy anywhere around here? Okay, we'll just have to do the best we can. I'll tell him exactly what to do and who knows, maybe he'll get the job done. I got the job done twice. Why don't you let me talk to him? Charlie? Why? - Where's my Gameboy? - I'll buy you a new one. She wants to talk to you. Keep it short. Alan, if I could keep it short, my life would be so much simpler. - Hello? - Now. What? I want you now. You've gotta be kidding. Charlie, I'm paying her by the hour. Just listen to her and do what she says. You're the boss. I'll get right on it. What did she say? She wants me to write a statement. And she wants you to take Jake out and buy him a new Gameboy. Why would she want that? For God's sake, Alan, you're paying this woman a lot of money. I suggest you take her advice. Jake, we're going out. I just want to make it clear that I would never behave in a way that would negatively influence my nephew. What was that? Is she allowed to do that? Mr. Harper, how many women would you say you have sexual relations with in any given year? Excuse me. I do okay. Ten, twenty, one hundred? - Come on, I don't keep count. - So we'll say, 10. I don't see the relevance of this. We are trying to establish Mr. Harper's lifestyle as a way of determining whether his home is a suitable environment for a young boy. Okay, let me just say here that I love Jake and I make it my business to see that nothing goes on in front of him - that is in any way inappropriate. - You tell him, Charlie. And it's significantly north of 10. I think we can move on. Do you have any more questions? - You are doing very well. - Thanks. Mr. Harper, is it true that Jake saw a woman in the shower with you? Okay, yes. Now in that instance, the door was closed, he didn't knock, and the door was closed and And I'm sorry, what was the question? - Woman in the shower? - Don't help them. And most important, he didn't see anything inappropriate. Then, what can you tell us about this picture that Jake drew? Okay, now that's a totally different Whoa, man! Whoa-man. Woman. She was in my kitchen wearing a T-shirt and she reached up for some SpaghettiOs. That's what she was reaching for. I'd like a moment to confer with my witness. You are making me so hot. I see. Look, Stuart, we both know you're on a fishing expedition here, right? - Maybe. - Maybe? You have no case. This man is a wonderful uncle. He provides a beautiful home, and the last time I looked, it wasn't against the law to be single in the United States of America. Oh, God! Bless America! Amen. The good news is your wife has given up on the custody issue, but we still need to finalize the property settlement. All right. Now, aside from your books, she's requested a few other specific items. - Like what? - A massage chair? Oh, no. Forget it. I love that chair. That was the only thing in my bedroom that moved when I touched it. Don't worry, Alan. I will get you your chair. I will get you your books. I will fight for you. I will win for you. And I won't stop until your wife is squished like a bug on a windshield. Okay, let's not lose sight of the fact that this bug is the mother of my child. So let's just keep the squishing to a minimum. Don't worry, you don't need a bathing suit. Once you're drunk, the ocean's not cold at all. - Charlie. - Hey, Alan. And Laura. Hello, Laura. I didn't know you were here. - Hi, Charlie, Crystal. - Hey. Yeah, I guess you guys know each other. How's that flu? It's better. This calls for a drink. A very large drink. I'm not getting billed for her time now, am I? Charlie? Okay, I know this is awkward, but let's keep in mind we agreed that you and I were just a casual deal, two consenting adults, no strings, no drama. I'm willing to admit that trying to boink your assistant might - Charlie! - Yeah? Now. What? I want you now. But see, now's really not a good time. I mean, you're working with my brother and Crystal took a sick day. Okay, that's a good point. Let me think this through. All right, there's just one way to make this work. I don't do threesomes, Charlie. - Then I'm stumped. - What's going on? Nothing. Not a thing. - Charlie, there's no reason to lie. - Are you sure? There usually is. I'm a little upset with your brother for getting involved with my assistant. I mean, it could be construed as a breach of ethics. Nice going, Charlie. This won't affect my case, will it? No, of course not, Alan. I'm a professional. If we're going to make it to that settlement conference on time maybe you should put on a jacket and tie. Nothing too nice. You're good. Do you think you can keep it in your pants till I get my stuff back? I'm trying harder than you think. Okay, we've got 15 minutes. Where do you want to do this? Hold on. It's not that I'm not into risky, semi-public sex, it's just that I am starting to resent your attitude. Charlie, we have a deal. Okay, Laura, look. I only went along with that because you are hot, and it took little to no effort on my part. Just make yourself at home, Crystal. That's the ocean. Anyway, I think we might be done here. - You're dumping me? - Yep. Now. You are going to be very sorry, Charlie Harper. Yeah, girls have been using that tired old line on me since the fifth grade. The next item is the rare book collection appraised at $12,000. Actually, our appraisers came in at $16,500. - Yeah. - Enjoy them. What? - I was only asking for half. - Why break up a collection? Okay, what's next? I understand there's a dispute over the massage chair. Not anymore. We concede. What do you mean we concede? We're not here for conceding. We're here for fighting and winning and squishing, remember? - Alan, I know what I'm doing. - Okay, moving on to the retirement fund. - Take it. - Take it? - Take it. - I'll take it. Are you out of your mind? - Okay, what else would you like? - What else? Judith, for God's sake, remember there was a time when you loved me! Cool. That was quick. Yeah, like every other time Judith screwed me. - What happened? - I'll tell you what happened. My settlement conference turned in to a drive-by colonoscopy. Charlie, have you ever heard of a divorce agreement that requires the ex-husband - to pay the ex-wife's dry cleaning for life? - Wow. Yeah, not just clothes. Drapes, rugs, slip covers, even suede. Sounds like she really took you to the cleaners. Sorry. So I fired Laura and tore up the agreement. I'm going to have to find a new attorney and just start all over. Good, then. No harm, no foul. Except for the thousands of dollars of extra legal fees. Yeah, that's got to sting a little. Not as much as having to buy Judith's parents a retirement condo in Boca Raton. She didn't even ask for that. Laura just threw it in. Lawyers. But you know what the interesting thing is? No, what? After it was all over and Judith and her attorney went dancing out of the room, I asked Laura why she had done this to me, and she said, and I quote, "Ask your brother. " So here I am asking you. Why, Charlie? Why did my very expensive Beverly Hills divorce lawyer sell me out? Okay. I'll tell you the whole story. But maybe you should sit down first. English   





                    			Alan? Alan, what are you doing? There are dust bunnies everywhere! So you're vacuuming dust bunnies? No. Their poop. It's all over the place. Are you sleepwalking? You're stepping in it! Don't step in it! Alan, why don't we leave the dust bunny poop until morning? - Click. - Hey! Come on. Let's get you tucked in, you crazy son of a bitch. - What? - You know. Okay, that's it, into bed. Nighty-night. If you feel the need to get up and clean something, maybe you can wax my car. For God's sake, Rose! Isn't there enough poop on the carpet tonight? What are you doing here? I'm sorry. I saw your lights come on and I was worried. Why were you looking at my house at 3:00 in the morning? Haven't you heard of the Neighborhood Watch? - We don't have a Neighborhood Watch. - Well, not yet. If we did, I surely couldn't stroll in here like I just did. Yeah. - So, what's going on? - Nothing. Alan was sleepwalking. - At least, I hope that was sleepwalking. - Sure. My parents used to put a football helmet on me - and strap me in bed. - You were a sleepwalker? No. - Good night, Rose. - Good night, Charlie. Thank you, I had a wonderful time. If crazy ever becomes an Olympic event, I get the first two legs of the relay. - What? - Nothing. Man, I'm living in a loony bin. Judith, I don't care what all the other divorced parents are doing. I don't think Jake needs to keep seeing the psychologist. No, I am not in denial. Judith, denying you're in denial is not denial. Okay, this is how it's going to be. I will have Jake at the psychologist's office at 11:00. You're welcome. Damn it! - What's wrong? - Nothing. Were you talking to Mom? Yes, but I hung up before I said the bad stuff. Yeah, she does the same thing with you. - Hey. - Morning. Why is the vacuum cleaner out? Because we were ankle deep in bunny poop. - Were you drinking last night? - Yes, but that's not the point. - You were sleepwalking. - Really? I have no memory of being up. Good for you, because I have no memory of being asleep. I'm sorry, I haven't done that since I was a kid. Yeah, well, if you're gonna regress, let me know, so I can stock up on rubber sheets. Okay, that was uncalled for! You want to go to the bowling alley and play some air hockey today? Sure, but you still owe me like $12,000 from last time. What are you gonna do, break my thumbs? Wouldn't hurt your game. Remember, we have Jake's session first. Man! I thought you didn't want him to go back to that quack. I didn't, but Judith and I talked, and we decided that what I want makes no difference whatsoever. Man, you are so whipped. I am not whipped! I'm just trying to keep everybody happy. - Meow. Fit-choo! - I am not "meow-fitchooed. " You're right. It's been a long time since you got any meow. Are we getting a cat? You know, this is a waste of time. Jake's a normal kid. But it's not gonna hurt to have someone outside the family he can talk to. Please. He's just sitting in there making stuff up. - What? - Well, not really making it up. He and I work out his schtick beforehand. Today he's telling her he sees dead people. Charlie, I am paying this woman a lot of money. Bet you feel pretty stupid, huh? What do you want me to do? Judith is insisting he comes here once a week. Okay, look, nobody likes divorce, but there are certain advantages. One of the more popular ones is you get to tell your ex-wife to bite the big one! - Or whatever you got left. - Yeah. That'll help. Look, it's just an hour out of our day. Which could've been spent on air hockey and bowling alley martinis. It's a small price to pay to avoid aggravating Judith. - Okay. I understand. - Thank you. You're a big girl. Okay. Are there any out here? - No. - Good. We'll see you next Saturday. Doctor, you should know, he doesn't really see dead people. Of course not. He's just trying to resolve emotional issues through visualized fantasy. Do you have my check? Dad, how come we never got spare ribs when we were at Mom's house? Because your mom thinks they're too fatty. Fit-choo! - Is that really necessary? - Hey, if the fit-choo fits. Fit-choo! Are you happy? - Come on, he doesn't know what it means. - Fine. Anybody see the pancakes for the moo-shu chicken? No, looks like they forgot them. Just eat it with a fork. You don't eat moo-shu with a fork. You eat moo-shu with a pancake, like a little Chinese taco. - Okay, all right. You want a taco shell? - No, I don't want a taco shell! I want a pancake for my moo-shu. I ordered pancakes. I paid for pancakes. Where the hell are my pancakes? - Alan, chill. - I will not chill. I want what I ordered. And for once in my life, I will get what was promised me! Fit-choo. See? Not a clue. I am gonna call that restaurant and give them a piece of my mind. That's smart. Scream at the people who handle your food. - Is he okay? - Yeah. Maybe a little tired. Just been working pretty hard. You know, my second grade teacher, Miss Spulvaney? One time she got mad 'cause there was no chalk, and they found her in the cafeteria hiding under a lunch table. - No kidding. - Yeah, she went berserk. That's how we got Miss McKinnon. - Hi. - Rose? How do you keep getting in the house? Charlie, aren't we past that? I thought you'd like to know that your brother is sleepwalking again. And you had to get in bed with me to tell me that? No, silly. I was already in bed with you. I just heard him walking around downstairs. Alan? - What are you doing? - Making a birthday cake. You and Mom want some? You handle this, honey, I'm going back to bed. - Jake, your grandmother's here. - Oh, man. I mean, right here in the room. Oh, man, Grandma's here! - I blame you. - Take a number. How could we be out of eggs? "Dr. Linda Freeman, Child Psychologist?" Who here's seeing a child psychologist? Jake. His mom was concerned about, you know, the impact of the divorce and everything. - On who? - On Jake. I'll be right back. I'm gonna go get some eggs. Jake, honey. I just want you to know that seeing a therapist is no reflection on you. - Okay. - It's a reflection on your parents. Particularly your mother. I think we're gonna get a cat. - The queen of darkness is here. - Thanks for the heads-up. - Where you going? - We're out of eggs. And you have no idea why? Well, Charlie, I would assume somebody ate them. Okay, let's go with that. And then I tried Freudian analysis, but with them, you know, it's just sex. - My doctor has a cow puppet. - Really? - M.D. Or PhD? - C-O-W. - Hey, Ma. Can I talk to you for a minute? - I'll be right there. Now, honey, the cow puppet doesn't need to know about the time you saw grandmommy dancing with the Cuban gentleman in the Neiman Marcus changing room. What is it, Charlie? I need to talk to you about Alan. He's been acting really strange lately. And I suppose it's my fault. No. Well, maybe. The thing is, he's been sleepwalking, and I remember him doing it when he was a kid. Yes. It was shortly after your father passed away. - What'd you do about it? - Well, nothing really. It seemed to stop by itself when he was 13. Right around the time he started taking those long showers and relieving his anxiety in a more direct way. Got it. So, sexual release cured his sleepwalking? Seemed to. Of course, there was a brief time when the two overlapped. I recall an incredibly awkward bridge game. Okay, great. Thanks. I had Seven No Trump and he just walked in with this goofy smile on his face. This is nice. Great idea, Charlie. I figure you work all week, you got your kid on the weekends. I bet you hardly even have the time to take a nice long soapy shower. - Yeah, it has been a little hectic. - Let me ask you something. When's the last time you had sex with a girl? Or a melon? Or anything? - None of your business - That long? - Why do you care? - I don't know. You just have that twitchy look of a guy who's got one stuck in the chamber. I'm fine, Charlie. Yeah, sure, I'd like to meet somebody. But in the meantime, I'm living a very full life. I have no complaints. This table is really starting to piss me off. Just let it wobble. You want beer in your lap? 'Cause I don't want beer on my lap. Hi, Charlie. Who's your cute friend? Just get up here, you jackass. Hi, Charlie. Who's your cute friend? Hi, Darlene. This is my brother, Alan. Come, please, join us. - Hi, Alan. This is my friend, Annette. - Hi. - Hello. - Hey, he is cute. You are. You know, Alan, Annette is a seat-filler for most of the major awards shows. - Is that so? - Yeah, it's a big responsibility. 'Cause when a celebrity gets up to go the bathroom, they don't want to have an empty seat on TV. Understandable. You know who pees a lot? Jeff Bridges. What do you say we leave and go back to our place? - Okey-dokey. - Wait, just hold it. - Everybody, sit down. - I feel like I'm at work. - What is going on? - Nothing. We met a couple of girls who took a shine to us. - Just like that? - Yes, Alan, just like that. - God, please tell me you did not pay them. - Hey, I resent that. Not all seat-fillers hook. Well, it was very nice meeting you. I'm leaving. Be right back. Keep drinking. - What is wrong with you? - Me? There is nothing wrong with me. I'm just I'm not interested in being set up with a woman whose idea of chit-chat is celebrity pee-pee secrets. - How about the other one? - No! You sure? 'Cause there's no way you're banging her on your own. - Why is this so important to you? - Are you kidding me? You've been acting nuttier than rat crap in a pistachio factory. I figured if I could coax your Johnson out of retirement, you'd stop making invisible birthday cakes. - What? - I can't say it more clearly than that, Alan. Are you happy? Anyway, I know you only deal with kids, but I didn't know where else to take him. This is ridiculous. I don't need to be here. I gave you a choice. Take the long shower or talk to the doctor. Okay. Well, if I had to guess, and that's pretty much all I do here, I would have to say that, based on his inappropriate outbursts and sleepwalking, Alan is struggling with a great deal of suppressed rage. Rage? No, I don't think so. Come on. Your wife threw you out of your own house, she still runs your life, you're broke, and you only get to see your kid two days a week, one of which you have to bring him to this rug rat exorcist. No offense. Okay. Now, Alan, how do you feel about what Charlie just shared? I think he's completely off base. Yes, I get a little frustrated sometimes, and when Judith doesn't get her own way, she just keeps coming at me and coming at me like a frigging steamroller. - Crushing my spirit and my self-respect. - That's very good. But on the other hand, she's a very good mom to Jake. Okay. I'll tell you what. Let's pretend that Judith is sitting in this chair. What would you tell her right now? Boy, I don't know. I feel a little silly talking to an empty chair. Fair enough. Charlie, do you mind? - Do I mind what? - Thank you. Now, Alan, tell Judith how you really feel. Well, Judith, I know you're working through some of your own issues, - sexual and otherwise, and I support that. - That's telling her, Alan. Charlie, remember, you're Judith. Sorry. That's telling me, Alan. Is this gonna take much longer? 'Cause I have to get to a massage, then a tennis lesson that he's paying for. - Tennis? Since when do you play tennis? - I told you, but you never listen. He never listens. Thank God his brother took him in. - Okay, I am warning you. - You're warning me? Okay, Alan, how are you feeling right now? - Well, a little angry. - Really? 'Cause you don't sound angry. Well, I am. I just don't see any reason to make a big spectacle of myself. Yeah, you'd rather blow off a sure thing who actually makes a living with her ass. Meaningless, loveless sex is not the answer, Charlie. - Meow, fit-choo! - Okay. I am really getting tired of that. Hey, you know what, Charlie? I don't much care for that, either. If you like, we can schedule another session to deal with your fear of vaginas. Now, Alan, the reason I asked you if you were angry is because I have yet to see any genuine expression of what are undoubtedly some very powerful feelings. I'm sorry, but that's just the best I can do. Okay, well, let's try something else. This is called a bataca. It's heavily padded, it can't hurt anyone, but you can use it to vent your deep, angry feelings. You're wasting your time, Doc. He's too much of a wimp. Attaboy, Alan! Let it go! Good! I'm so mad! I hate you! - Who do you hate, Alan? Who do you hate? - Everybody! - Good! Let it go! Keep going, Alan! - Wait a minute! Stop! Should I stop? Well, it's up to you. You paid for the full hour, so Attaboy. Hit him! Thank you, Doctor. That was great. I feel much better. - Good. - Yeah. We're all thrilled for you. And by the way, about the You know. I'm not scared of them. I just have a healthy respect. Fine. We'll see you both next week. How long am I gonna have to keep coming here? English   





                    			Jake, time to go! Get your stuff together! After you drop him off at his mom's, you want to see a movie? - Sure, that sounds good. - Cool. Enjoy. Why don't you just tell me you've got a girl coming over? - I didn't want to rub your nose in it. - Thanks. - She's gorgeous, by the way. - Wonderful. Why are you putting Jake's stuff all over the house? I want this girl to see I'm not just another jerk trying to get her into bed. - I'm a loving uncle. - Who's trying to get her into bed. That's the loving part. This is the book I read to him at bedtime. You don't read to Jake. That's why you're going to the movies! Okay, ready to go. Is your skateboard still out by the front door? - Sorry, I'll bring it in. - No. Leave it there. See, I do this thing where I trip over it, then I bitch a little bit. I'm harried, but lovable. - You got everything? - Yep. - What about your schoolbooks? - Oh, right. So, what time are you expecting Little Red Riding Hood? And I'm the big, bad wolf. Very clever. And not a bad game to play later. A little huffing and puffing and blowing. That's The Three Little Pigs. Same wolf though, right? - Okay, I got my schoolbooks. - And your homework? Charlie, if you took half the energy you put into manipulating casual sexual encounters and used it to actually build a relationship, you'd be a lot happier. Hard to imagine. Are you saying you never want to settle down? You mean get married? Let me tell you something, bunky. If you've got someone to clean your house and do your shopping and you're getting action on a regular basis, the only reason you need a wife is if you have some sick compulsion to give away half your stuff. - What about kids? - I already got one! And the best part is he leaves before we get sick of each other. Right, dude? - Right, dude. - Okay, let's go. - Bye, Uncle Charlie. - See you next week. - Where are your shoes? - Oh, right. I have been so depressed since the divorce, I've gained eight pounds. And not one ounce went to my boobs. Honey, you're still better off without the rat bastard. But I miss the rat bastard. Listen to me, Kathleen. I thought I missed my husband, too. But it turned out to be just a little prescription mix-up. - Hi, Mom! - And there's my big boy! - Don't I get a hug? - Nope. Gotta drain the lizard. Boys. - Hey. - Hi, Alan. - He left his homework in the car. - Thank you. Hang on, I have some bills you need to pay. Great. I hope they're really big ones. Hi. Alan. So you must be Judith's support group. That's funny because I'm kind of supporting her, too. It's not funny ha-ha so much as not funny. Cookies! Maybe this will take the taste of foot out of my mouth. So, who's the little baker among us? Foot. - Can I have a cookie? - Sure, sweetie. - You are so cute! - I know. You have a girlfriend yet? No, I'm a bachelor like my Uncle Charlie. So, you're never going to get married? As long as I got someone to clean my house and action on a regular basis, I don't need a wife. Excuse me? I don't want to give anybody half my stuff. Okay, bye-bye. This is my favorite part of the house. I call it God's room. Are you religious? Tiffany, how can you not be when you look at something like that? In fact, I'm always telling my little nephew what's important is this. Not the big house, or the fancy car, or all the expensive toys I'm always buying him. You are amazing. I don't know many guys that would make room in their lives for someone else's child. He's family. What kind of a man doesn't make room in his life for his own family? Look, it's my brother Alan, who I also made room in my life for. Excuse me. Bro! All right, you moron, what part of "stay out, so I can run around naked with a hot chick" didn't you understand? I'm sorry, I'm too depressed to sit through a movie. And you figured ruining my evening would cheer you up? The movie was just a suggestion. Go bowling, go sit on the curb, I don't care. Leave me alone! - Who's that? - Judith. Again. She's really upset with me. - Man, I'm sorry. - Thank you. Now get out. Get out? She's upset with me because of you! That's different. But still, get out. Your sexist, manipulative attitude towards women just got into Jake's head, and he spewed it out in front of his mother's angry women's support group. Wait a minute. Is it a women's support group that's angry? Or a support group just for angry women? What difference does it make? If they are already angry, then I'm less culpable. Okay, what did Jake say? Not much. He just parroted your line about how women are only good for sex and cleaning the house. Charlie, you didn't really say that? No. What I said was is that there is really no reason to get married if you've already got somebody to clean and You want to go to the movies with me? Man, Jake's going to love this video game. Listen to this. "Sixteen levels of ultra-realistic murder and mayhem, "twenty-four flesh-ripping weapons, "plus gratuitous nudity. " Let me see that. - "Scooter's Magic Tree Fort"? - Scooter's a zombie. It's Tiffany. She still talking to you after last weekend? What can I tell you? I am hard to stay mad at. Hello? Hey, Tiff. I've been thinking about you all week. Yeah, we did get off to a bad start, and I really blame myself. No, I'd love to try again. I'm going to go get Jake, but I'll leave the front door unlocked in case Satan shows up to collect your soul. Wait a minute. Alan? I gotta put you on hold a sec, Tiff. How come Judith's not bringing him over? I don't know. Judith asked me to do it, and I just got tired of arguing. She still busting your chops about what Jake said? Look, blame it on me. - Tell her I'm sorry. - She won't buy it. Sure she will. Women are suckers for a good apology. Just keep shoveling it on till roses start growing in it. Poor Satan. He'll come for your soul and he'll leave empty-handed. Hey, Tiff, I'm back. That's kind of harsh. Wait a minute. Hello? I see, that's not the hold button. - Hey, is Jake ready? - Not exactly. Maybe you should come in for a second. Judith, how many times have I asked you to have him ready when I Hello. - Sit down, Alan. We want to talk to you. - We? Yes. Sit down. Okay. I guess I can stay for a minute. - No cookies. - No cookies. - Alan, Jake is not here. - Why not? Where is he? - He's sleeping over at a friend's. - What are you talking about? This is my time with him. - Yes, I know, but - Judith feels she can no longer allow her son to be exposed to the toxic influence of your brother. Wait a second. We have a custody agreement. Yes, but Judith feels that the welfare of her son supersedes that. - You can't do this! - Yes, she can. - Who are you? - They are my friends. Wait. What the hell do your friends have to do with this? - We love and support her. - And we won't let you bully her. Wait. Okay, first of all, can the person I talk to be the person who answers me? That's fair. Okay, I don't want to talk to you people. This is between me and Judith. You're absolutely right. Judith, tell him what we agreed. Okay. You can see Jake on weekends, but not at Charlie's house. But that's where I live. I'm sorry, Alan, but you're just going to have to choose between your son and your brother. You know what? Maybe I have a problem with Jake being in this toxic environment. And I am not leaving until you bitter old crones are out of my house and I have my kid back! All right. You can stay. But I want my kid. Okay, I will go. - Morning. - Hey. - Where are the pancakes? - What pancakes? You always make pancakes on Saturday morning. I make them for Jake. Jake's not here. - Kind of weird without him, huh? - Yes. Would it lift your spirits if you made pancakes for me? I'm sorry, man. I told you to blame it all on me. Charlie, they had moved way past blame. It was more like a jihad. Except with no cookies. Your big mistake was dealing with them as a group. The trick with women is to split them off from the herd, one by one. Otherwise, they spook and you risk a stampede. Kind of like buffalo. In fact, I will bet that's where that song comes from. Buffalo gals, won't you come out tonight Come out tonight Do you hear yourself? "Buffalo Gals"? Are you insane? This is the kind of talk that started this whole mess! I didn't write the song, Alan. - Morning. - Morning, Berta. - What, no pancakes? - Jake's not here this weekend. Why not? Apparently Jake took something I said out of context and repeated it in front of his mother and she overreacted, as is her nature. What did you say, numbnuts? All I said was if your domestic chores are taken care of by one woman and you have an active sexual life with other women, you don't necessarily need yet another woman with whom to tie the matrimonial knot. And which category do I come in under? I got to say it's the sweet loving, Berta, because this place is a mess. Morning, everybody. I brought real maple syrup for the pancakes. - There's no pancakes, Rose. - Because Jake's not here. Because Charlie's an idiot. Why? I mean, "Why is Jake not here?" Not "Why is Charlie an idiot?" Because we know that. Hello? Where's my grandson? Oh, God, make this stop. Good morning, all. - Hi, Mom. - Morning. - So, where's Jake? - Ask Charlie. - Yeah, ask him. - Charlie? See? Just like buffalo. No, Evelyn, I am sorry. I want you to be able to spend time with your grandson but I just don't want him around Charlie. Why? Why do you think? That's right. No, his attitude toward women is not a reflection on you or how you raised him. Yes, it is. Look, there's someone at the door, I've got to go. No, Evelyn, I don't think this would seem less important if I was "getting a little. " - Judith, can't we talk about this? - There's nothing to talk about, Charlie. Okay. Don't talk. Just listen. I love Jake and I would never intentionally do anything - to influence him in a negative way. - I don't care about your intentions. Okay, I am a jerk, I am immature, I am self-centered, I am Hi, I'm Charlie. Yes, we've heard about you. And I will bet none of it's good. - I am sorry, what is your name? - Linda. Linda. Really? I once had my heart broken by a woman named Linda. Charlie, we are having a meeting. And I'll bet it was about me. - Am I right? Come on, be honest. - Mandy. Mandy. I love that song, Mandy. Listen, I know I can't come in here and ask to be forgiven for some of the stupid things I have said in front of Jake. But I do have the right to say I am sorry, don't I? I suppose. - Thank you. And you are? - Kathleen. Kathleen, a fine Irish name. Half-Irish, on my mother's side. - Are you and your mom close? - Yeah, I guess. I envy that, Kathleen. - Me and my mom - Okay, Charlie, give it a rest. We are not a bunch of sorority girls you can charm with your big, brown eyes. And nice smile. Thank you, Mandy. Linda, I admit I sometimes relate to women on a very superficial level, but I think that's because deep down, I have intimacy issues that probably go back to my mom. My mother crippled me emotionally! You, too? And I am so afraid I'm making the same mistakes with my daughter. - You know what - Ruth. That's the same fear I have with Jake, Ruth. I've clearly made mistakes, but that's because I'm human. And after all, what're we trying to do with our children other than to raise them as humans? Stop it, Charlie. "Our children"? You have no children. That's true. Although I don't think it's fair to throw it in my face. I mean, some of us haven't been blessed with the little ones the way you have. That was uncalled for, Judith. Look, I'm being real up-front with you about the mistakes I've made with Jake. How I've influenced him. But let's talk for a minute about how he's influenced me. How this little boy has made me a better man. Dear God! You are not going to listen to this crap, are you? No, I will not He's lying to you. That's all he does! Lie! You've got to believe me. It's okay. It's all right, Judith. We are all here for you. Okay, who's ready for a refill? That kid. What are you going to do, huh? Charlie, where's the little girl's room? It's down the hall to the right, and around here we leave the seat up, so don't just drop trou and back in. - You are terrible! - I'm serious. I'm not coming in there with the shoehorn. You are getting a little pink there, Kathy. Turn around, I'll put some more suntan lotion on your back. Okay. - Hi, Alan! - Hello. - You have a lovely home. - Thank you. What's happening? A bunch of us came over to have wine in God's room. Why don't you join us? Thank you. What the hell? Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight Come out tonight, come out tonight Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight And dance by the light of the moon - Hey, Dad. - Hey, pal! What's going on? - I want my friends back. - I am sorry, what? - Hey, Uncle Charlie. - There he is. How you doing, buddy? We missed you around here! - I slept over at Toby's house. - Cool! Jake, honey, go put your stuff in your room. Okay. - He's staying? - Okay, here's the deal. We go back to the original custody arrangement, but with one new condition. What's that? Charlie agrees to never, ever, enter my house again. Done. - You want some wine? - Charlie Yeah, sure, why not. How? I told you, I am hard to stay mad at. Anyway, they're your problem now. I am going to hang with Jake till Tiffany gets here. What? You got a normal-sized head. Thanks. I am pretty happy with it. - I don't get it. - What don't you get? I heard Mom say the reason Uncle Charlie gets into so much trouble is because he thinks with his little head. It's not that little. - Okay, you tell your mother - Charlie. That women are to be honored and respected. See, Jake? That's the big head talking. But he only has one head. You want to tell him or should we let him spin for a while? I'd rather he spin. Come on, at least give me a clue. All right. What do men have that women don't? Beards. - Lower. - Beards. You're right, let him spin. English   





                    			Hello? What? I can't understand you. Who is it? I don't know. Some woman crying. Hold on. Charlie? - What? - Phone for you. - Who is it? - A hysterical woman. Are you insane? I don't take calls from hysterical women. Here he is. You are very insensitive. Hello? Oh, hey. How are you? She's crying. Duh. Okay, calm down. I can't understand you. Omelet? What is "omelet"? Oh, I'm late. What are you late for, hon? - Get him out of here. - Jake, go watch TV. What's the big deal? I don't cry when I'm late. Okay, are you sure? Don't yell. How did this Scratch that. Okay. Just stay calm, I'm here for you. We'll deal with this together. You didn't happen to catch her name, did you? Okay, the instructions sound pretty clear. You pee on the stick, and if it turns blue it means you're pregnant. The stick turns blue. Yes, sweetheart, first go into the bathroom. Not exactly a rocket scientist. As opposed to the Nobel Prize winners you usually bring home. I'm still here. Go ahead, let her rip. What do you mean you can't? Hold on. How's that? Yeah, I'm a genius. Now we wait 30 seconds. Please, God. Please, God, please. Isn't it a little late for prayer, Charlie? Hey, don't mock my faith. Yeah, I'm here. Did it change colors? No? That's good, right? Sure, in a strange way I'm a little disappointed, too. Hold on a sec. Yes! So, what else is new? Hey, congratulations. When's the wedding? Isn't that nice? Best of luck. Bye-bye. Boy, don't you just hate when that happens? Wait, so this is a common occurrence? Don't you take precautions? Of course. But, come on, you've never found yourself in a slow elevator without a condom? Look who I'm asking. Okay, so we need soap, razor blades, cotton balls. - Cotton balls, that reminds me. - Reminds you of what? Ribbed, for her pleasure. Ultra thin, for mine. Fiesta colors for, I suppose, fiestas. And extra-strength, double latex, for coyote Tuesdays. Boy, if women knew the trouble we go to. Why don't you just get snipped? - You mean a vasectomy? - Yeah. Then say "vasectomy. " Don't say "snipped. " - What's wrong with "snipped"? - It's demeaning. Snipped is what you get for $12 at Supercuts. Fine. Why don't you get a vasectomy? I've considered it. In fact, a couple of years ago I believe there was a petition circulating. So, what's holding you back? I don't know, it's kind of a permanent move. What happens if one day I finally meet the right woman and decide I want to raise a family? Don't cry. Look. You want to see Daddy dance? You like to see Daddy dance. Look at Daddy dance. Who am I kidding? Sweetheart, I have to go. I've a patient. No, you just stay off your feet. Remember, you're very pregnant. Huge. Yeah, I love you, too. I know. We're going to have a baby. Yes, we are. Okay, sweetie, bye-bye. So, Mr. Harper, you want a vasectomy? Yes. You do that, right? Of course we do. In the exam room next door. Snip, snip. Great. I just have a couple of pre-snip questions. Shoot. Which, by the way, you'll still do post-snip, if that was one of your questions. Good. Of course, if I've done my job right, you'll be shooting blanks. Yeah? Yeah, I got that. What I was wondering is if there's any permanent effects. You mean like sexual impairment? No. Wait a minute. There can be sexual impairment? No, I just wanted to see the look on your face. No, actually, you'll be able to perform exactly as you did before. Great. But what about like creativity? See, I write music for a living. Will I still be able to do that? Do you write with your testicles? No. Then it shouldn't be a problem. Now, let me ask you a question. - Do you have children already? - No. Then you might want to think about freezing some sperm in case you ever change your mind. - Frozen sperm? I don't know. - Why not? You know, you freeze shrimp, it's never as good as fresh. That's really not the same thing. So you know for a fact that frozen kids are just the same as the regulars? Yeah, pretty much. Of course, when they grow up they do tend to migrate to the Sunbelt. Nothing? Wow. That one kills at urology conventions. Excuse me. Yes? Put her on. It's my wife. Hi, honey. No kidding, she's really kicking up a storm, huh? Yeah, we know it's a girl. - Good. - Hang on. Do you like Brittany or Allison for a name? - They're both nice. - Yeah. Okay, honey, let me get this guy out of here and I'll call you back. Okay, Mommy. Yeah, you're going to be a mommy. Yes, you are. So, frozen sperm. I'm just not really sure I want to go into some little room with a bunch of magazines and you know Actually, we have videos now. Kind of hot. You don't have to do it here. We'll give you a container, you can go home, make yourself comfortable, dim the lights, put on a little sweet soul music I know the procedure. Then just bring it back here while the little fellas are still swimming, and we'll turn them into Popsicles. Popsicles? You know, in case someday you want to be a pop. Yeah. Very clever. You deal with prostates and penises all day, you better have a sense of humor. And warm hands. That's good, I'll use that. Warm hands. That's good. Yeah. I'm done. Can I go play in my room? Jake, Grandma came all the way over here to spend some time with you. Alan, don't use guilt as a control mechanism. He should only spend time with me if he wants to. So I can go, right? Run. Good morning. - Good morning, darling. - Morning, Charlie. Charlie, what's wrong with your pee-pee? What? A little birdie told me you were in a urologist's office yesterday. Thanks a lot, Tweety. I didn't say anything. Coincidentally, your doctor has a suite in the same building as Dr. Shankman. The man responsible for one out of three tight tushies in Beverly Hills. So, Dr. Shankman saw me and told you? No, you left your appointment card on the table here. I just brought up Dr. Shankman because no one has noticed my new tushie. Very nice, Mom. Of course. It's a Shankman. So, Charles, back to your pee-pee. I'm done. Can I go play in my room? There's nothing wrong with it. I'm just getting a vasectomy. You must really hate me. Are we changing the subject? How can you have a vasectomy without consulting me? You're selfishly robbing me of grandchildren. - You've got grandchildren. - Oh, big whoop, one. If it makes you feel any better, I'm going to do the freezing thing. Really? I suppose that's better than nothing. You know, I'm doing a freezing thing, too. - What? - Excuse me? At death, I plan to have my head removed and frozen until such time as it can be revived and put on a monkey body. What? Everybody's doing it. Charlie, you got somebody in there? No. I need to get your towels. I really wish you wouldn't. Come on, I'm doing laundry. I want to finish a load before I go. Yeah. Well, me, too. - What? - Never mind, just go away. All right. If it helps, you can think of me. Charlie, wait a second. I don't have to pick up Jake till after dinner. You want to catch an early movie? Maybe. But I gotta make one stop first. Come on. So, what's in the bag? - Sperm. - No, really. Sperm. - Whose sperm? - Seabiscuit's. Who do you think? Mine. I thought we were going to a movie. Yeah, but first I'm having my sperm frozen and getting a vasectomy. I could've met you at the theater, you know. Just hold the bag. There is another container inside this bag, right? Of course. You just gotta keep it out of the sunlight. Why? Is it vampire sperm? Jeez. He's gonna want to look in the bag. God. No! - What the hell did you do that for? - I don't know, I panicked. - Hey, Charlie! - What? Are you nuts? You can't put that in the freezer. It's ice cream. Store-bought, not hand-cranked. Yeah, you're hilarious. You're lucky I'm still talking to you after tossing my swimmers on the Coast Highway. - What? - It's nothing. Thanks to you, I got to reschedule the whole deal for this afternoon. - What whole deal? - It's not important, Jake. Why shouldn't he know? Okay, go ahead. Explain it to him. Well, Jake, your uncle Charlie is getting a vasectomy. What's wrong with the car you have now? Well done. All right, let me try again. A vasectomy is a very simple operation. - Are you sick? - No. I'm perfectly healthy. It's a procedure so that I don't have babies by accident. Yeah, like we had to do with Scout. Scout? The dog we had. Couldn't keep it in his fur. Keep going, you're doing great. Jake, it's not exactly the same with people as with dogs. I know. Why don't you just use a condom? I guess he knows more than he lets on. - You do, don't you? - I hear things. Thanks for babysitting, Rose. My pleasure. Is Charlie gonna be okay? Yeah. He's just having a little procedure done, and I need to be there to drive him home. - What kind of procedure? - It's personal. I understand. Where is he? Upstairs, getting ready. Throwing a few things in a bag. - I'll tell Jake you're here. - Okay. - Charlie? - Rose, for God's sake! - You need a hand? - No, get out. - Charlie? - What? - What's the little cup for? - Go away, Rose. Don't be embarrassed. That's a perfectly natural way to relieve stress. You know what I do? Jumping jacks. Rose, please. The only downside is, when I exercise, I get all hot and sweaty, and my clothes start clinging to my body. So then I have to go and take a nice, hot, soapy shower. Then what? Rose? Oh, damn. Look, I'm sorry I walked in on you. I thought you were finished with the video and everything. - Forget it, Alan. - I wish I could. Why didn't you hang a sock on the doorknob? It wouldn't have helped. Obviously, a power much greater than myself doesn't want me to freeze my sperm. If you don't, and you go ahead with this vasectomy, you'll never be able to have children. What difference does it make? We both know I'm not daddy material. No, not now, or any time soon, but who knows, maybe in the distant monkey-body future. Look, this is my life. I know what's best for me. Okay, Mr. Harper. Why don't you jump up on the table, put your legs in the stirrups and we'll get you shaved. Damn, I didn't bring the camcorder. - Thanks, Alan. I'll see you later. - Yeah. Good luck. Don't forget to put a cone around his head so he doesn't bite at the stitches. All right, let's have a look. Okay, in my defense, it's a little cold in here. Boy, if I had a nickel for every time I heard that. So, what's your name? Naomi. Let me ask you something, Naomi. Does doing this make you want to have dinner with me more or less? Just a reminder, Mr. Harper, I'm holding a razor to your genitals. I know, but how "meet cute" is this? What a great story to tell our Our what? Never mind. - Okay, all done. - That was quick. You got a little mirror so I can check out the back? Not that little. Come on, honey. I know. Breathe with me. All right, that's good. I gotta do one quick snip and then I'll meet you at the hospital. - Excuse me, quick snip? - No, thanks, I'm fine. Yeah. I love you, too. Breathe, honey. Just breathe. Okay, bye-bye. It's getting exciting now. Okay, let's see what we're up against here. Woof. That's quite a haircut. Looks like my grandma in a bathing cap. Okay, Mr. Harper, I'm gonna give you a local anesthetic here so you're gonna feel a little sting. Just let me know when you're about to. Holy Mother of God! Okay, here it comes. Kidding. I got you. Now, we'll just give it a minute till we're nice and numb. You know, we're thinking Juliet now, or maybe Julianne. Both good names. Yeah, you want a name that fits a child, but also is appropriate for an adult. Can you feel my finger? What finger? Why? What are you doing? Okay, let's start snipping. Naomi, could you get that for me? Hello? Hi, honey. No, I can talk. What, you're kidding, already? Okay, don't panic, I'm on my way. Okay, this is a little embarrassing, but I have to go. Why don't you see to it that Mr. Harper has another appointment? And no charge for the haircut. Yeah. I'm gonna be a daddy. Man, he looks really happy. Yeah, they've been trying for a long time. You can put your legs down now. Yeah, that's one option. - Unbelievable. - Let it go, Alan. Who goes in for a vasectomy and comes out with a date? What? I'm a man, she's a woman. A woman who two minutes after you met her was shaving your scrotum. So we skipped ahead a little. - You feeling any calmer, Uncle Charlie? - What do you mean? When Scout had his operation, he got real calm. Then he got fat and only wanted to sleep behind the dryer. Okay, first of all, it's not the same operation. And second of all, I didn't even have it. - So you're gonna have kids? - I don't know. Maybe some day. I hope so, because you'd be a cool dad. Really? - Did you hear that? - Yeah. So, you're not gonna have the vasectomy? I tried my best, but it just wasn't meant to be. What do you mean? Do you think it was a coincidence that my urologist was having a baby at the very moment I was about to get snipped? I mean, I'm not a particularly religious guy, but clearly a power much greater than myself wants me to knock somebody up some day. You called? English   





                    			The snap, the kick is up, and it is good! It is good! - Man.
 - Okay, well, that's the game.
 Dad, can I have my allowance? Sure.
 Here.
 Thanks.
 Here.
 Pleasure doing business with you.
 You're taking my son's allowance on a football bet? Hey, when he wins, I pay off.
 You know, minus the vig.
 Minus the vig.
 You're charging him for the privilege of making a bet? That's what the vig is, Dad.
 Face it.
 He's not gonna learn this stuff in school.
 I don't care.
 Give him his allowance back.
 Fine.
 You get no allowance.
 That's your punishment for gambling.
 - Told you he'd do that.
 - Yeah, you did.
 Pleasure doing business with you.
 Hey, listen.
 After you drop him off at his mom's house tonight, do me a favor? - Just make yourself scarce, okay? - What's her name? Or is it too early to ask? It's not a girl.
 I'm just having friends over.
 Oh, poker? Oh, can I play? - I'm better than I used to be.
 - It's not poker.
 Wait.
 A flush beats a straight and a full boat beats a flush, right? - Right A full house and a full boat are the same so I won't say "full houseboat" anymore.
 - It's not poker, Alan.
 - Then what's going on? I'm just having some friends over to smoke cigars sample some fine single-malt Scotch and, you know, talk.
 I enjoy all those things.
 Well, Scotch makes me a little gassy.
 But I'll take a Beano and I'm good to go.
 That's nice, but I don't think you'd be comfortable.
 - Why not? - Because we talk about personal things.
 - You mean like a support group? - No, no, no.
 It's not a support group.
 It's just guys who get together to talk about their lives.
 - That's a support group.
 - No, it's not.
 Okay, it's not.
 It's not.
 Got it.
 So why can't I come? Because these men are my friends.
 There's a level of trust and confidentiality.
 - I'm your friend.
 - No, you're my brother.
 Wait a minute.
 You don't consider me a friend? It's not up to me.
 A friend is someone you choose.
 A brother is someone you get.
 - Excuse me? - There's no choice involved.
 Your dad just wakes you up in the night and says: "Your mom wasn't really fat and this isn't your room anymore.
" So all these years, I've just been an intruder to you? An inconvenience? A burden? Well, sure.
 You can spin it that way.
 You know, I had no idea you felt this way.
 I am very, very hurt.
 Okay.
 But you'll still make yourself scarce, right? - Bye, Uncle Charlie.
 - See you, buddy.
 - Oh, he's your buddy? - Alan, don't start.
 How is he your buddy? You didn't choose him.
 - I chose to let him stay here.
 - You chose to let me stay here too.
 No.
 I chose him, I got you.
 You know, there are times I just loathe you.
 And yet you're surprised I don't consider you a friend.
 Okay, have your real friends to your little "support group.
" - It is not - It is a support group! It's a support group for weak, rudderless men.
 And I wouldn't be a part of it if you begged me.
 Okay, bye.
 Dad, check this out.
 You can pick your friends you can pick your nose, but you can't pick your friend's nose.
 - You know who told me that? - I can guess.
 Uncle Charlie.
 And you know why it's funny? Because it's true.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Have a nice week, Jake.
 Bye, Dad.
 Hi, Mom.
 Can I have my allowance? I missed you too, sweetie.
 - Thanks for dropping him by.
 - Judith, hold on.
 Do you consider us friends? I consider you my ex-husband.
 I know.
 But putting aside for the moment our loveless marriage and messy divorce we always had a certain camaraderie, am I right? Can we talk some other time? I'm having people over for dinner.
 Oh, really? Anybody I know? - Sandra and Howard.
 - Oh, no kidding.
 Can I say hello? - I'd rather you didn't.
 - Why not? Sandra and Howard are my friends too.
 In fact, I introduced them to you.
 Well, why don't you call them and invite them to your house.
 This is my house.
 Those were my friends.
 The fact is, you're having my friends for dinner in my house.
 Yes, Alan, that is exactly what's happening.
 Well, when I'm right, I'm right.
 I've got something I wanna talk about, but it's gotta stay in this room.
 Everything stays in the room.
 Yeah, sure, Judas.
 Does that include veiled references in one of your wise-ass songs? - I said sorry about that.
 - Too little, too late.
 We have to go through this every time we get together? - It's water under the bridge.
 - Thank you.
 It wouldn't have killed you to thank him in your Grammy speech.
 That I would've done, but, you know, Bacharach, he just went on so long.
 Well, get on with it.
 All right.
 How do I say this? Do any of you get up in the middle of the night to pee? - Sure.
 - Occasionally.
 Sometimes, I don't even get up.
 This is what I can't write songs about? Oh, drat.
 All right, look.
 It's not about peeing, per se.
 It's about getting older.
 I'm laying in bed with my wife.
 She looks beautiful, sexy.
 All I wanna do is finish my Corn Pops and go to sleep.
 What are you doing? Shopping list.
 You know, just a shopping list.
 So you're saying the old flag's at half-mast? No, the old flag is fine.
 And I'd rather not refer to it as an old flag, if you don't mind.
 No, my point is, it's about shifting priorities or something.
 Flag, drag, hag.
 I will knock your glasses through your eyeballs.
 I will do it.
 Let me tell you something, fellas.
 It doesn't matter what the calendar says, you're as old as you feel.
 Me, I feel like boiled crap.
 - Hello.
 - Oh, man.
 I'm sorry, guys.
 It's my brother.
 We agreed you weren't gonna be here.
 Don't worry, I just need my phone book.
 - Is that? - Yes.
 - And that? - Yeah.
 And that? He used to be.
 Not anymore.
 Him I don't recognize.
 He's our bookie.
 You can have your bookie, but not me? Bookies, like friends, are chosen.
 Okay.
 Okay, fine.
 I'm sorry to interrupt.
 I need my address book so I can call one of my friends.
 They don't care.
 Hurry up and get out.
 Hurry up and get out.
 Sounds like sex with my ex-wife.
 I don't know if Charlie told you, but I'm recently divorced and it's been kind of a rough road.
 - Here's your phone book.
 - Thank you.
 Of course, I guess in hindsight, I should have seen it coming, but - I'm gonna count to three.
 - Bye.
 Sorry about that.
 He's bent out of shape because I told him he couldn't be part of the group.
 - Why not? You just saw him, didn't you? Trust me, he doesn't get any better.
 I mean, he actually thinks this is a support group.
 This is a support group, Charlie.
 You're the only one who's pretending it's about Scotch and cigars.
 Whatever kind of group it is, we have rules about new guys joining.
 Well, but he's your brother.
 He's obviously going through a rough time.
 Seems like you should be more supportive, pal.
 Hey, I support him plenty.
 I share my home with him.
 I share my food with him.
 I moved my foosball table so he could park in my garage.
 What more do you people want from me? Let me tell you something about sharing, kid.
 Sharing is a two-way street.
 When you share with another human being you always get back more than you gave.
 Assuming that you're smart enough to share with somebody that's got more stuff than you had in the beginning.
 Hey, Dick, it's Alan.
 How's it going, buddy? Oh, good, good.
 Listen.
 You maybe wanna catch a movie tonight? Oh, really? You and Roz are at Judith's too.
 Interesting.
 So in addition to my house, half my money, and my self-esteem Judith got custody of all my friends.
 No, no, no, I don't wanna take it up with her.
 I Hi, Judith.
 No, no.
 I'm not trying to ruin your party.
 In fact, I've got a little party of my own.
 Alan, come back to bed.
 I'm cold.
 Be right there, baby.
 I gotta go, Judith.
 Bye.
 Well, that's a new personal low.
 You know, as long as we're talking about getting older I was at this club the other night, window-shopping.
 I realize I'm the oldest guy in the bar.
 I mean, I still look good.
 But I'm competing for women with guys who are way younger.
 I gotta tell you, I felt kind of depressed, like maybe my best days are behind me.
 Oh, you're breaking my heart.
 There's maybe 11 women in this city who haven't saluted his old flag.
 We should talk about Charlie and his brother.
 What? Why? We've been meeting all these years and I never even knew you had a brother.
 I didn't see that it was relevant.
 Let me tell you something about relevant.
 The root of the word relevant is "rel" which is also the root of the word "relative.
" Your brother is your relative, ergo, your brother is relevant.
 What? Another "rel" word is "relapse.
" But I'll wait my turn.
 Hi.
 Is this Doug Ziskin? Yeah, yeah.
 Hey, Doug, it's Alan Harper.
 I'm your chiropractor.
 But I'm calling as a friend.
 Well, I'd like to think we are.
 Forget it.
 Sorry I woke you.
 Hey, neighbor.
 What are you doing out here all by your Ionesome? Charlie's got some friends over and I thought I'd give him some space.
 Oh, yeah.
 His support group.
 He claims it's not a support group.
 Oh, please.
 He also claims he's not in love with me.
 What do you want, Rose? Nothing.
 I was just sitting over there in Charlie's car and thought you might like some company.
 From the minute they brought him from the hospital everything was about the baby.
 "Don't wake the baby.
 Don't tease the baby.
 Don't paint the baby.
" Then when he starts growing up, it gets worse.
 Everything he does, I get blamed for.
 He wakes up one morning with no hair and one eyebrow, it's my fault.
 They find him tied to a street lamp and big surprise, everybody's looking at me.
 Charlie, you need to stop resenting your brother just for being born.
 Hey, I don't resent him for being born but he abused the privilege.
 Even now, with you guys.
 I jumped through hoops to get into this group.
 I had to be recommended, then I had to get to know you guys.
 Now Alan thinks he can waltz right in because he's my little brother? It's not fair.
 Let me tell you something about fair.
 What? Charlie, you know in your heart the right thing to do.
 Fine.
 You want him so bad, I'll get him.
 You know, Sean never speaks about his siblings.
 All right, back off, Mary Poppins.
 You're working on my last nerve.
 Believe me, Alan, I understand how hurtful it is to be rejected by Charlie.
 And I found that the only way to get through it is to just love him more.
 That, and every so often, sneak into his bedroom and try on his underwear.
 Helpful tip.
 Hello.
 - Oh, hello, Charlie.
 - Yeah, listen.
 I've been thinking.
 Why don't you take a Beano and come back to the house and join the group.
 Oh, really? What changed your mind? I had a small stroke.
 What difference does it make? Get your ass back here.
 Well, did it occur to you that I might be already otherwise engaged? - No.
 - Well, I am.
 It would be inconvenient for me to return right now.
 Why? Where are you? Where am I? Well, that's none of your business.
 Are you in the garage? Oh, please.
 What on earth would I be doing in the garage? Cut it out, Rose.
 You're being silly, Alan.
 Charlie is reaching out to you.
 Yeah, right.
 Last time he reached out I wound up tied to a street lamp on Wilshire Boulevard.
 All right.
 Are you gonna come back inside or do I have to drag you in by your big, flappy monkey ears? Listen to him, Alan.
 He's begging.
 No, thank you, Charlie.
 I am quite happy chatting out here with Rose.
 Okay.
 I tried to be the loving brother, you sulky little weasel.
 That really wasn't necessary, Alan.
 Yes, it was.
 You're my friend.
 And friends don't just abandon friends because something better comes along.
 Then this might sting a bit.
 I have something else to do and I'm pretty sure it's better.
 All right, I asked him nicely.
 He said no.
 Let's move on.
 Coop, what's up with your fixation on women who resemble Tobey Maguire? I think I finally got over that one.
 I went to see Spider-Man 2.
 Nothing.
 Hi, everybody.
 Thanks for the invite.
 I know I'm the new guy.
 So I'll hang back and try not to disrupt the flow.
 So is there any protocols I need to know about? Any customs, traditions, a talking stick? No, there's no talking stick.
 But there is a "shut the hell up" shoe.
 Okey-doke.
 As you were.
 All right, I've got something I wanna share.
 The panic attacks have come back, and I just don't understand it.
 Everything is great.
 My career, my marriage.
 I should be on cloud nine and instead of which I've got this free-floating anxiety and feeling of impending doom.
 And the diarrhea.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 It's just that my panic attacks come with diarrhea.
 First the clammy hands, and then the nausea, and then the aforementioned you know.
 Sorry.
 I changed my mind.
 I want him gone.
 Can we shave his head and fill his mouth with hair first? Let me tell you something about hair.
 The clammy hands, that's how it starts.
 Wait a minute.
 You can't just kick him out like that.
 You didn't want him here in the first place.
 But I'm his brother.
 It's my right to reject him.
 You guys wanted him.
 Now that he's here, cut him a little slack.
 Can't you see? He doesn't fit in here.
 Of course not.
 He doesn't fit in anywhere.
 He's a weird little guy who makes phone calls from the garage.
 It's not his fault.
 His big brother didn't look after him, didn't teach him anything.
 I'm trying to make up for it with his son but this annoying little ship has sailed.
 Thank you, Charlie.
 You can stop now.
 No, I got your back.
 I want this twerp in the group.
 A problem with that is a problem with me.
 Oh, now you've got my back? - What? - A little late, don't you think? Alan, I'm defending you.
 And I'm asking where you've been for the past 35 years.
 Let me tell you what it was like growing up.
 Un-freaking-believable.
 What it was like to look up to No, to worship someone who on two occasions tried to trade you for an underwater flashlight.
 It wasn't for keeps.
 No, no, no.
 It's my turn now, Charlie.
 All I ever wanted was his approval, his friendship.
 And all I ever got was my underwear yanked up to the base of my skull.
 And the sad part is that I looked forward to the wedgies because it was the only form of love that I could get from him.
 - That is sad, Charlie.
 - It's terrible.
 Charlie, don't you think there's something you have to say to your brother? Yeah.
 Come here, buddy.
 Okay, buddy.
 Here's the gag In the words of some wag She loves my flag Rally round the flag Wow, Elvis, that was beautiful.
 But, you know, in all honesty I really loved your earlier, you know, angrier stuff.
 You know, "Pump It Up.
" Now, that was a song.
 I gave you that.
 Oh, and while we're on the subject, Sean why don't you do funny stuff like you used to? I mean, Fast Times ruled, man.
 Come on, do a little Spicoli for us.
 Guys, this isn't funny.
 Clammy hands.
 Nausea.
 Guys? Hey, guys? Guys?   






                    			Tequila, checkbook, sourpuss.
 Must be alimony time.
 Go away, Charlie.
 Boy, you'd think for all that money, she'd at least come and give you a lap dance.
 - Leave me alone, Charlie.
 - In fact, you know what'd be funny? Where it says "memo," write "lap dance.
" Give her something to explain at tax time.
 Charlie, you Okay.
 - So where's Jake? - Sleeping at a friend's.
 - He'll get dropped off tomorrow.
 - Oh, man.
 - I rented a movie he'd like.
 - Oh, what'd you get? Don't worry.
 It's educational.
 One Million Years B.
 C.
? How is this educational? Raquel Welch running from dinosaurs in a fur bikini? What is that if not history? I'm afraid you're gonna have to watch it by yourself.
 Won't be the first time.
 What's the deal with that giraffe? How come you bring it out every time you write an alimony check? It's symbolic.
 Do you wanna know what it's symbolic of? No, I'm good.
 I made it in ceramics class for Judith when we were dating.
 All these years I've been shelling out for tennis bracelets and satin underwear.
 Some women aren't impressed with jewelry and lingerie.
 Well, sure, if you wanna date a dead girl.
 Hey, I just realized.
 Your name is Al, and you're sending your ex-wife money so it's "Al-i-money.
" Hey, hey, I just realized, your name is Charlie and you're a moron.
 Be that as it may.
 If you gave her the giraffe, why do you have it? When Judith kicked me out, I wanted to get back at her.
 She took the house, she took the car, she took the money.
 - I felt I had to take something.
 - So you stole bric-a-brac.
 - Symbolic bric-a-brac.
 - Oh, right.
 You see, now every month when I write the check I can look at it and remind myself what a pathetic loser I am.
 No, dude.
 You don't need a giraffe for that.
 Get rid of the damn thing.
 You're killing yourself with this bitterness.
 What, you think I'm hurting myself more than her? No, I don't think you're hurting her at all.
 You need to move on, buddy.
 You're right.
 You're right.
 And you know what would be truly symbolic of that? Getting your knob shined by a keno waitress in Laughlin? No.
 No.
 Me bringing this back to Judith and apologizing for taking it.
 I like my idea better.
 Okay, here's the plan.
 I'll bring this little fella back to Judith, and clean the slate.
 Did you even consider my idea? - You drive.
 - Why do I have to go? Because I am obviously too drunk to drive.
 What does that say about your plan? Alan, wait.
 You can't stop me.
 I am giving Judith back the giraffe.
 Oh, I don't wanna stop you.
 I just want a good view.
 Okay, you can stay.
 Charlie, look at this.
 What is this? "The Harpers.
" - Yeah, so? - She's not the Harpers anymore.
 She's the Harper.
 That mat is a complete lie.
 Yeah, and it's in cahoots with the mailbox.
 Come on, ring the bell.
 You and me, we're the Harpers.
 Us.
 Oh, Alan.
 Hi.
 Dr.
 Melnick.
 Is Jake all right? I assume so.
 He's spending the night at a friend's.
 Oh, that's right, that's right.
 Dr.
 Melnick is Jake's pediatrician, so naturally, I thought Oh, okay.
 Looks like somebody else has given your wife the giraffe.
 Make sure they didn't forget the garlic balls.
 What are you doing here? Why don't I just get back in the hot tub and give you guys a minute.
 - Well? - I came to give you this.
 - What is it? - I made it for you.
 - Just now? - No, no, a long time ago.
 It's symbolic.
 Alan, you're a disturbed man.
 You need help.
 Enjoy those garlic balls.
 Wow, that was more fun than I expected.
 - Come on, giraffe boy, I'll buy you a drink.
 - Okay.
 Wait, wait, wait.
 Our pediatrician.
 My ex-wife is sleeping with our pediatrician.
 I wonder if she gets a lollipop after every visit.
 You know, you're actually a very lucky man.
 Oh, really? Really? How am I lucky, Charlie? Show me the luck.
 Well, first of all, if Jake ever gets sick or hurt free medical care is only a hot tub away.
 Well, that's true.
 He is good with kids.
 I begged her to do it with me in the hot tub.
 She said it made her hair frizzy.
 Well, apparently, she's found the right conditioner.
 What if she's serious about this guy? What if she marries him? - Even better.
 - Better? How is it better? Show me the better.
 If she marries him, you're off the hook for alimony.
 That is better.
 In fact, if you saw the big picture, you'd encourage this relationship.
 This guy is a real catch for you.
 Don't let him get away.
 You're right.
 Maybe I should go back there and, you know, bless their union.
 - No, no, no.
 You provided the woman and the hot tub.
 - That's enough for one night.
 - Yeah, I guess.
 - Probably even paid for the garlic balls.
 - Yeah.
 - Could I get some more coffee, Berta? - Who's stopping you? Get your own damn coffee.
 - Well, Charlie, you're finally up.
 - Hey, Mom.
 - Where's my grandson? - He's at a sleepover.
 - He'll be here later.
 - And no one calls me? I wouldn't come over if I'd been told he wasn't here.
 Good to know.
 Where's your brother? His car's not in the driveway.
 Hey, Mom, I'm not even sure where my pants are.
 All right.
 Well, looks like you and I get to spend a little quality time together.
 Gee, I'd love to, but I got my regular Sunday morning softball game.
 - Charlie.
 - Yeah.
 It's Saturday.
 Damn.
 - Oh, you're still here.
 - Yeah.
 - Listen, Alan, I'm really sorry about - No, no, no.
 I should apologize to you.
 Showing up last night unannounced.
 That's completely inappropriate.
 And I came by to tell you it won't happen again.
 So you came over unannounced to apologize for coming over unannounced? I was afraid you'd pick up on that.
 - Is Judith up yet? - Actually, she's not here.
 She ran to the market.
 Up and out this early on a Saturday? Good for her.
 She used to sleep a lot when we were together.
 It was probably just the depression and the meds.
 - Meds? - Oh, no, it was nothing serious.
 Just your everyday little pink pill to turn that frown upside down.
 Alan, I gotta tell you, this is a little awkward No, please, don't feel awkward.
 Look, we're obviously going to be seeing each other a lot.
 There's no reason for anybody to feel uncomfortable.
 That's a very mature attitude.
 Thank you.
 Well, you're welcome.
 So let me make you some coffee.
 Are we supposed to believe that cavewomen waxed their legs and wore fur bikinis? It's not a documentary, Mom.
 You know, I'm not gonna be around forever and the time will come when you'll regret ignoring me.
 - Charlie, why do you hate me? - What? Whenever I come, you do everything you can to avoid spending time with me.
 Obviously not everything.
 We're spending time together right now.
 You're just staring at the television, and it's not even on anymore.
 I can still see you.
 Charlie, look at me.
 - How long you wanna do this for? - I want you to talk to me.
 - Okay, I'm out of here.
 - No, no, wait, Berta.
 - Come, sit, talk.
 - Mommy-and-me time over already? - He hates me.
 - No, I don't.
 - Please, Berta, I need you.
 - I'm done.
 I wanna go home.
 - Berta, I'm begging you.
 - Oh, all right.
 So why do you hate your mother? Here we go.
 Coffee, juice, and my secret stash of Mint Milanos from the back of the freezer.
 Just a tip: If you want quality cookies around here, you gotta hide them.
 Judith eats Pepperidge Farm like she's going to the chair.
 So tell me a little bit about yourself.
 Ever been married? - My wife passed away.
 - Oh, I'm so sorry.
 No alimony, though.
 Gotta love that.
 Hey, hey, here's a funny thing.
 My name's Al and And I give Judith money.
 So it's So it's alimony.
 - Wouldn't it be "Al-i-money"? - I was afraid you'd pick up on that.
 - You got kids? - No.
 Well, that's a blessing.
 What with the dead wife and all.
 - Mint Milanos? - No, thank you.
 So anyway, kids.
 Hey, you know, it's not too late for you.
 Judith is a wonderful mother.
 We're not at that stage in our relationship.
 Oh, of course not.
 On the other hand, you don't wanna wait too long.
 She's no spring chicken.
 You know, eggwise.
 So I'm having this nice Mother's Day dinner with my slutty daughter and her idiot boyfriend.
 Suddenly, the front door comes down and the room fills with tear gas.
 Next thing I know, I'm belly-up on the floor, hacking out a lung while the cops are dragging out Bonnie and Claude in handcuffs.
 Come to find out that the money that I loaned them to open a tanning salon was used to turn my tool shed into a hydroponic pot farm.
 - Unbelievable.
 - Yeah.
 Your daughter came to visit on Mother's Day.
 Sure, what ungrateful mutt doesn't visit their mother on Mother's Day? - One year I forgot.
 Let it go.
 - When's my birthday? - Excuse me? - You heard me.
 - What's that got to do with anything? - You don't know your mother's birthday? - Well, not by heart.
 - Charlie.
 - What? She changes it all the time.
 - Just the year, not the day.
 Hey, I just realized something.
 I can leave.
 Fine.
 But before you go, just tell me one thing.
 - What? - Why do you hate me? Oh, Mom, for God's sakes, l Rose! No, no, no.
 Rose, wait.
 Rose, come on in.
 Look, my mom's here.
 You like my mom.
 - Oh, sure.
 Hi, Evelyn.
 - Hello, dear.
 - Are those my pants? - Oh, no.
 I bought these.
 But I think this might be your wallet and keys.
 Evelyn, you get younger every time I see you.
 Oh, aren't you a dear.
 And thank you for the birthday card.
 - Oh, did you get it on time? - Yes, I did, and it was lovely.
 So sweet of you to remember me.
 How could anybody forget your birthday? Well, yeah.
 You know, she does become a little emotional at times, huh? I thought she was getting over your divorce.
 No, no.
 She was over the divorce while I was still packing.
 No, what you're seeing is low blood sugar.
 The trick to that is to always have some Fun Size Snickers in your pocket.
 - It'll perk her right up.
 - Really? Oh, yeah.
 Oh, and here's another tip.
 When she starts crying for no reason, and she will never say, "Don't cry.
" And try not to touch her.
 - Okay.
 - Or whistle.
 Never, ever whistle.
 Okay, maybe I forgot a birthday or two.
 Maybe I don't return every single call.
 But that doesn't mean I hate her.
 Was he breast-fed? Of course he was.
 Not by me personally.
 That's interesting.
 I see the bras that come through here and he does tend to favor the big yams.
 - I do not.
 - Oh, really? - Raquel Welch.
 - Hey, that's a damn fine film.
 Come to think of it, the night we were together he did spend a freakish amount of time on my boobies.
 I mean, foreplay is one thing, but, golly, it was like making love to a cat.
 Rose, for God's sake, you're talking to my mother.
 Sorry.
 A very giving cat.
 He's always had an oral fixation.
 When he was little, he used to suck on other children's thumbs.
 And now he's always got a bottle of booze in his mouth.
 My therapist says that's his way of stuffing his feelings.
 - That's what my therapist says.
 - Hell, I could've told you that for free.
 - Hey, I'm here.
 - Hey, it's Jake.
 Back from his sleepover.
 Look who's here to see you, buddy.
 Hi, Grandma.
 Hello, sweetheart.
 Thank you for the lovely birthday card.
 - My mom picked it out.
 - Oh, and you love her, don't you? - Sure.
 - Thank you.
 You can go now.
 - Can I go too? - We're not done with you.
 - Where were we? - We were trying to figure out why Charlie hates you.
 - Yeah.
 Well, Charlie? Okay, fine, here it is.
 I'm not saying I hate you, but if I did it might have to do with the fact that you're a narcissistic bloodsucker who drove my father into an early grave.
 Then married a succession of men who couldn't care less about Alan and me which was fine with you because you looked at us like dancing monkeys you could just haul out whenever it suited you.
 And when it didn't, you sent us off to boarding school or camp or that kibbutz in Israel, where we got beat up because we weren't even Jewish! And now, now you show up here every chance you get to lay a guilt trip on me for not appreciating my cold, Ionely, loveless childhood.
 Well obviously you're not ready to talk about it.
 - Alan, you really don't have to do this.
 - Hey, hey, I am a licensed chiropractor.
 If Jake had a sore throat, I'm sure you'd treat him, prescribe something.
 But it's nothing, I think I just slept wrong.
 Oh, that's probably because you're not used to our bed.
 So have you? Have you met Judith's parents? - No.
 - Oh, they are just gonna love you.
 They were devastated by the divorce.
 Not to mention some of her unfortunate choices thereafter.
 - Unfortunate choices? - Oh, you know, that's not important.
 What's important is they're just gonna be relieved to see she's dating a man.
 You carry a lot of tension up here.
 Alan.
 - Didn't you just pay your alimony? - This is the pediatrician's bill.
 - Jake was sick? - No, no.
 The pediatrician had to see an orthopedist.
 You know Mom's birthday was a couple weeks ago? Yeah, I sent her some flowers and a card.
 Oh, man.
 Would it have killed you to put my name on the card? I did put your name on it.
 I wrote, "Love, your sons, Alan and Charlie.
" - Damn.
 - What? She tricked me into thinking I forgot.
 






                    			I don't know what he did, Charlie.
 The teacher called and told me to come get him.
 I want it on the record that if the kid was running a blackjack game under bleachers he didn't get it from me.
 What? I said, he didn't.
 Well, I can assure you he did not learn that kind of crass behavior from me.
 Maybe I should wait in the hall.
 Hold on.
 What is he doing here? Well, my car is in the shop, and Charlie was nice enough to give me a ride.
 No, Charlie was nice enough to call you a cab, but you wouldn't take it.
 So, what's going on? Your son gave his teacher the bird.
 Okay, I want it on the record that he didn't necessarily Charlie, just leave it alone.
 What exactly happened? I was writing on the board and he thought I couldn't see him.
 - Is this true? - Yeah, I really thought she couldn't see.
 I'm afraid this kind of behavior is grounds for suspension.
 - Maybe we can catch a matinee.
 - Yeah.
 Jake, why did you flip Miss Pasternak off? Excuse me.
 We don't end our sentences with prepositions.
 We say, "Why did you flip off Miss Pasternak?" I think that answers your question.
 Jake, why did you flip off Miss Pasternak? Because she picks on me.
 Jake, I don't treat you any differently than any of the other students.
 - Yeah, right.
 - Shut up.
 You know, I'd like to talk to your parents alone.
 - Come on, Jake.
 - What, I don't even get to tell my side? Buddy, you're 11.
 You have no side.
 This isn't my fault.
 I was provoked.
 - You were provoked? - Yeah, it means I know what it means.
 And it doesn't matter.
 What you need to do now is apologize.
 - But I'm not sorry.
 - You don't have to be sorry.
 Just say it and look it.
 You've got those big, cute kid eyes.
 Use them.
 - That would be lying.
 - That's your line in the sand? You muttonhead, you just flipped off your teacher.
 - Yeah, but I was being honest.
 - And look where it got you.
 I think I just lost my innocence.
 He's really a very well-behaved boy but he has had some problems dealing with our separation.
 That's true.
 Although it wasn't so much a separation as a kicking out.
 I sympathize, but if I gave special consideration to every child whose parents are going through divorce, I'd be getting the finger all day.
 We're not saying he shouldn't be punished.
 - He certainly should.
 - But just let us try to handle it.
 By "us" he means me.
 I always have to be the bad guy.
 You're better at it than me.
 Than I.
 You are such an ass.
 - Can we have a moment, please? - I think that'd be a good idea.
 And it's, "May we have a moment, please?" Stop it.
 Miss Pasternak.
 I'm sorry, we haven't officially met.
 - I'm Jake's uncle, Charlie.
 - Hello.
 And I am really sorry.
 This may not be my place and if it's not, I am really sorry but Jake has something he wants to say.
 I am really sorry.
 - And I'm really sorry too.
 - Why are you sorry? The kid may have gotten the rude gesture from me.
 I'm not used to being around children and, well, I am really sorry.
 Well, thank you.
 I appreciate it, but it doesn't change what Jake did.
 You're right.
 You're absolutely right.
 Jake, go to the vending machine and get Miss Pasternak a peach Snapple and a bag of Skittles.
 It is Miss Pasternak, right? Now, this one's called "Read Between the Lines.
" You're giving the finger, but you've got plausible deniability.
 Cool.
 Like the Itchy Eye.
 Exactly.
 Now, this one's called "the Slow Crank.
" Charlie.
 As you can see, it's effective but lacks deniability.
 - Dad, check it out.
 Balloon Finger.
 - Okay, that's enough.
 Do we need to be teaching him more ways to flip people off? Flip off people.
 Charlie, do you realize how close he came to being suspended today? - I do.
 - And do you understand how lucky we are Miss Pasternak decided to give him a chance? Lucky? Sure, why not.
 Let's call it luck.
 What does that mean? It means I'm too modest to call it skill.
 - Hey, Dad.
 - What? How come only one finger is the bad finger? I don't know, Jake.
 This one's okay, right? Right.
 - Dad.
 - What? Anything? No.
 I don't get it.
 Who decides? Uncle Charlie, I had a weird dream.
 And it's getting weirder.
 Hey, buddy.
 Why aren't you asleep? I'm hoping I am.
 - Hello, Jake.
 - Hello, Miss Pasternak.
 Listen, buddy, Miss Pasternak and I are kind of having a sleepover.
 Because we're like, you know, friends.
 No way.
 Jake, I'm only your teacher from 8: 15 to 3:00.
 After that I'm just a person like anybody else.
 This is more wrong than the time I saw Santa peeing at the mall.
 Okay, why don't we wrap up this after-school special and call it a night.
 Don't worry.
 This won't change anything between us at school.
 So you're still gonna be mean to me? That's right.
 Same old junkyard dog.
 - Come on, buddy.
 Get some sleep.
 - Oh, yeah.
 Like I'm gonna sleep now.
 - Do you think he'll be okay? - Sure.
 He's just not used to seeing his teacher out of the classroom.
 And her pants.
 I'll talk to him in the morning and make sure he's okay and that he keeps this to himself.
 - Thank you, Charlie.
 Oh, Miss Pasternak.
 Why do you never call me by my first name? I don't know.
 This just seems way hotter.
 - Charlie? - Yes, Miss Pasternak.
 Do you think Jake believes we're just friends? Why not? We are, right? I mean, once I get to know you better I'm pretty sure I'd consider you a friend.
 Charlie, we both know there's much more than friendship going on between you and me.
 - Much more? How much more? Well, I know this is pretty quick and I don't wanna use the L word - Good.
 Thank you.
 but this feels an awful lot like love.
 I'm sorry, which L word didn't you want to use? Oh, Charlie.
 Come on.
 - Let's go to sleep.
 - Yeah.
 Like I'm gonna sleep now.
 - Morning.
 What are you doing? - Morning.
 Making my world-famous huevos rancheros for my brother and nephew.
 No kidding.
 What stupid thing did you do you're trying to make up for? Why do you always just assume that? I slept with Jake's teacher.
 Oh, Charlie, did you learn nothing from the den-mother fiasco? It gets worse.
 The kid found out.
 - What about your brother? - He doesn't know yet.
 Oh, hey, you made breakfast.
 What's the occasion? No occasion.
 Just trying to help out.
 Well, thank you.
 I really appreciate it.
 Good morning, Berta.
 Morning, you goofy, clueless bastard.
 Nice to see her in a pleasant mood for a change.
 Yeah.
 Sit down.
 Have some huevos.
 - Fresh-squeezed orange juice.
 - You squeezed this? No, it says it on the can.
 Okay, what stupid thing did you do? Well, funny thing I slept with Miss Pasternak.
 Charlie, what were you thinking? What if Jake finds out? Okay Oh, no! Oh, no! How? - He woke up in the middle of the night - You brought her here? Did you learn nothing from the den-mother fiasco? - Hey, I kept him from getting suspended.
 - Oh, that's how? - You're welcome.
 - Are you crazy? No, but I have a sneaking suspicion Miss Pasternak may be.
 - What's that supposed to mean? - Don't worry, I'll deal with it.
 Oh, that makes me feel much better.
 So how did Jake take it? Did he freak out? Not as much as you.
 - Morning.
 - See? He's fine.
 Jake, do you wanna talk about what you saw last night with Uncle Charlie and Miss Pasternak? Oh, God.
 That really happened? Good, Alan.
 Way to go.
 Dad, can I be homeschooled? Listen, Jake.
 Don't worry.
 You go to school, don't say anything to anybody.
 I'll tell her I can't see her anymore and we'll forget this happened.
 Man, it's like Cub Scouts all over again.
 - I hope you saved room for dessert.
 - I saved room for you.
 You sure? Because I'm just empty calories.
 How about a nice fruit cup? Two fruit cups, please.
 Listen, Delores.
 We need to talk.
 Oh, call me Miss Pasternak.
 No, let's keep this friendly.
 Dolores, you're a terrific woman and I've enjoyed being with you very much but I know deep in my heart that you can do so much better than me.
 - Okay.
 I understand.
 - Good.
 Thank you.
 You're insecure.
 But don't worry.
 I am not going to abandon you.
 No, no, no, that's not what I'm worried about.
 See, Delores I'm a bad man.
 I'm a player.
 I go from woman to woman and then Charlie, that's the past.
 I'm not going to give up on us, and you wanna know why? Why? Because somebody told me that we belong together.
 Really? It can't be somebody who knows me.
 Oh, he knows you very well.
 And he loves you even more than I do.
 Our union has been ordained, Charlie.
 What? Come again? After we fornicated I prayed for forgiveness and I was told not to worry about it.
 By the same guy? There's only one guy, Charlie.
 And his loving hand has been guiding me ever since I quit pole dancing in Reno.
 No kidding.
 Which club? - Did you dress like a schoolteacher? - It doesn't matter.
 What matters is the same hand that delivered me from my life of degradation has brought me to you.
 For what? More degradation? No.
 To help you become a better man.
 To achieve your potential.
 Now sit up straight and eat your fruit.
 - All right.
 - All right, what? All right, Miss Pasternak.
 Hey, Charlie.
 Guess who.
 I know we didn 't make plans for tonight but we really should get together  and talk more about this path we are on and where it's heading.
 We know where it's heading but it would mean a lot to me  to hear the words come out of your mouth.
 Your beautiful, blessed mouth.
 Call me, sweetheart.
 Boy, it's weird being on the other side of one of these calls.
 I can imagine.
 Well? - Professional opinion? - Please.
 Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.
 Yeah, I thought so.
 I mean, she barely knows you.
 Where does she get off being so forward? Rose, we had one night together and you handcuffed yourself to my refrigerator.
 That was different.
 We were meant to be together.
 Okay, I was gonna ask you the best way to end this but I realize now that breakups may be outside your area of expertise.
 Yeah.
 I do mate for life.
 I'm like a penguin that way.
 Plus, I like to slide across the ice on my belly.
 Uncle Charlie, guess what happened with Miss Pasternak today.
 - I'm just about to break up with her.
 - Oh, no, don't, don't.
 - Why not? - Look at this.
 Hey, you got an A in history.
 - Way to go, Jake.
 - Look at his answers.
 "Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in pen.
" For this he got an A? Everybody got an A.
 She was, like, happy all day.
 She even gave me back my fake dog poop.
 Charlie, I gave you this poop.
 You broke into my house and left it on my pillow.
 Still, you regifted.
 And I thought you were a classy guy.
 Jake, why don't you go to your room and do your homework.
 She didn't give us any.
 First time ever.
 I love you, Uncle Charlie.
 - Oh, man.
 - Yeah.
 Yeah, I think you know what you have to do.
 - Break up with Miss Pasternak, right? - Hell, no.
 He's getting A's.
 He hasn't gotten an A since naptime in kindergarten.
 - But he's not learning anything.
 - Charlie, get your priorities straight.
 I'm trying to get him into a decent middle school.
 After he's accepted he can learn that Sacajawea wasn't "a bag full of jawea.
" - Ready for dinner? - Charlie! It's so good to see you.
 It's okay to see you too.
 - Charlie.
 - What? - Gum.
 - Oh, sorry.
 What a great day I had.
 All the kids were so well-behaved.
 Even Jake.
 - That's nice.
 - Can I tell you a little secret? I never really cared for Jake.
 But you said you treated him like all the other kids.
 Well, you have to say that.
 So where are we going to dinner? I hadn't really decided.
 You came unprepared? Charlie, you have so much potential if only you'd apply yourself.
 All right, I gotta tell you.
 My weirdness bar for chicks is pretty high but you are clearing it in street shoes.
 You're mad at me.
 - No, no.
 - Yes, you are.
 - No, no.
 Not Not mad.
 - Then what's your problem? Nothing.
 Forget it.
 Let's just have a nice evening.
 Oh, Charlie, that is so sweet.
 Let's never fight again.
 Oh, no.
 I hate it.
 Hey, can I use the restroom? May I use the restroom? Oh, right.
 - May I? - You're excused.
 Thank you.
 Charlie.
 Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work out with Miss Pasternak.
 You gotta know, I went the extra mile to make her happy.
 Alan, you know what that means, and Jake, you'll understand someday.
 Oh, come on, guys.
 I said I'm sorry.
 Okay, she's being really unfair with all this homework.
 You know what I'll do? I'm gonna complain to the principal.
 Maybe you should date the principal.
 Very funny.
 Is that an option? Because I would if it would get me out of writing 2500 words on The Red Badge of Courage.
 Man, book reports suck.
 - Dad.
 - Yeah? Please keep him away from my karate teacher.
 






                    			- Hey, Alan? - Yeah? You had the "just say no" talk with Jake, right? Of course.
 Why? What talk did you have with him? No talk, it's just that he's It'll be more fun if you see it.
 I'm guessing you don't mean fun for me.
 Tell the truth.
 How proud do you feel at this moment? What the hell is he doing? I don't know.
 Ten bucks says he hits the ceiling if we turn on the garbage disposal.
 - Jake, what are you doing? - Breathing.
 Breathing.
 Any particular reason you're doing that in the sink? I have to practice.
 Man, the girls are gonna love him when he grows up.
 - Jake? - Yes? - I'll bring him up.
 - Yeah.
 Hey, that's not funny.
 I could have drowned.
 And then we'd have found your body days later, washed up on the dish rack.
 - Where did you get all this snorkel stuff? - Greg bought it for me.
 - Greg? - Yeah, you know, Dr.
 Melnick Mom's boyfriend.
 He's a real cool guy.
 He's gonna teach me how to scuba-dive after I learn to snorkel.
 We're gonna need a bigger sink.
 He's got a gigantic boat with bedrooms on it, and scuba tanks and wet suits.
 We're gonna go diving off Catalina.
 Wait till you see the flippers he bought me.
 Well, Judith's boyfriend sounds like quite a guy.
 - Yeah.
 - You okay with that? Oh, yeah.
 Yeah, I'm fine.
 This can be a sensitive area for divorced guys.
 - I know.
 - Ex-wife sleeping with another man.
 - Son starting to bond with him.
 - Yeah.
 Yeah.
 - Big boat.
 - Charlie, what's your freaking point here? No point.
 Just drilling for the nerve.
 So, what do you think? You wanna go bowling today? Maybe catch a movie? No, I'm gonna take another bath.
 He does know there's an ocean out there, right? Well, Greg doesn't want him in the ocean.
 He wants him to spend time training in a pool.
 In fact, my son's a little unhappy about being here because he wanted to go snorkeling in Greg's pool.
 He's got a boat and a pool? I guess you can afford cool stuff when you don't have to sell your blood and sperm to make alimony payments.
 Hey, hey, my relationship with my son is not based on having cool stuff.
 And lucky for you.
 - Come on, look at the bright side.
 - What bright side, Charlie? Delineate the bright side.
 Maybe one weekend Greg will let us take a couple of chicks out on the boat.
 Why on earth would he lend us his boat? He's tight with Jake, we're tight with Jake.
 We've got an in.
 Are you not hearing my pain? My son likes Judith's boyfriend better than me.
 Hey, I don't even know him and I like him better than you.
 You'd think I'd learn.
 Alan.
 Alan, your son loves you.
 You're a big influence on him.
 - You are the most important role model.
 - Oh, I guess.
 I mean, so what if you can't teach him to scuba-dive.
 For that matter, you can't teach him to ski or hit a curve ball or anything cool, really.
 But you bring plenty of other things to the table.
 Thank you, God.
 - Hello, Charlie.
 - Always a price, isn't there? - Hello, Alan.
 - Jake's taking a bath.
 As much as I'd love to spend time with my grandson, I'm in a hurry.
 Need to borrow your Mercedes.
 Well, since you're in a hurry, I'll give you a quick answer.
 No.
 Charlie, please.
 I'm showing a house in half an hour.
 What's wrong with that little electric car you bought? Nothing, it's fine.
 It's what anybody who cares about this planet is driving.
 If you're trying to sell real estate to a Saudi oil prince you can't be driving up in some little toy car with a plug in the bumper.
 You could use my car, Mom.
 You see? Now, that is how a loving son treats his mother.
 Thank you, sweetheart, but I need to look successful.
 - Charlie, your Mercedes.
 - No, forget it.
 - Charlie, I am not leaving until you give - Happy motoring.
 Thank you.
 My car is in your driveway.
 And if you lose power, there's a kite and a key in the trunk.
 For the record, there are other ways of measuring success besides cars.
 You're right.
 There's boats and pools.
 You know what? I hope Mom puts a dent in your big, shiny, new Mercedes.
 Hey, don't say that.
 If you're gonna hope for something, hope she drives it off a cliff.
 So this is pretty cool, huh, Jake? An electric car.
 I guess.
 What happens when the batteries run out? You plug it in and recharge it.
 But what if there's a blackout? You sit in the back seat with a pistol and wait for the looters, just like any other car.
 - Charlie.
 - It's a cool car, Jake.
 Greg has a really cool car.
 He has a Hummer.
 You know, your Uncle Charlie's no stranger to Hummers.
 Charlie.
 That's a cool car too, Jake.
 So, Jake, this is pretty cool, huh? Driving in a futuristic car, going to see a movie.
 Hey, maybe afterwards we can go get some pizza.
 Sure.
 And then, who knows, maybe Maybe your old dad will buy you an excessively violent and bloody video game.
 How's that sound? Okay.
 You know, when we go scuba diving Greg's gonna teach me how to steer his boat.
 Well, I am sorry, Jake, but, you know, I don't have a boat.
 I don't have a Hummer, and I don't know how to scuba-dive.
 It's okay, Dad.
 Greg does.
 Hey, Jake, how'd you like your dad to teach you how to drive a car? - What? - Really? Charlie, he's 11.
 So? We'll find an empty parking lot.
 - What if he hits something? - Alan, it's Mom's car.
 Guess what? Daddy's gonna teach you how to drive.
 Cool.
 Can you reach the pedals? - Yeah.
 Can we turn on the radio? - Forget the radio.
 Which one's the window squirter? Okay, forget the squirter.
 Now, come on, focus.
 This is your rear-view mirror.
 It's very important to check it before you back up.
 - Okay.
 - Now Well, what do you see? The top of Uncle Charlie's head.
 A shopping cart, a tree, soda can.
 - Looks like Mountain Dew.
 - Okay.
 Forget the rear-view mirror.
 We're just We're just gonna go forward.
 Now, you know, this is the brake and this is the gas.
 Thought it was electric.
 He's got you there, Alan.
 Okay, this is the brake and this is the electric.
 They're very, very sensitive.
 You don't have to press hard.
 Okay.
 Now, give it a little tap.
 - It is on? - No.
 - Brake! Brake! Brake! - Brake! Brake! Brake! Okay.
 Apparently it is on.
 - This is awesome.
 - You see how careful you have to be? And how much closer we are to the Dumpsters? - Can I squirt the windows now? - No.
 Now Okay, why don't you turn the wheel slightly to the left and very gently press down on Brake! Brake! Brake! Remember, if you wanna drive Grandma's car again you can't be telling her about it.
 - I know.
 Or Mom, or anybody else.
 Daddy doesn't need the grief.
 That was really cool, Dad.
 Thanks.
 - Yeah.
 Yeah, it was.
 - Hey, it just occurred to me.
 If Greg's here, we can ask him about going out on the boat.
 No, I'm not going to ask Greg about going Hi, Judith.
 Here he is, safe and sound.
 - Hey, honey.
 - Hey, Mom.
 Guess what we just did.
 - What? - Nothing in particular.
 That's a kids' joke.
 "Nothing in particular.
" He's been doing it to us all weekend.
 - So, well, okay.
 Bye.
 - Alan.
 Alan.
 Ask about the boat.
 - Listen, next weekend - Yeah, yeah.
 I know.
 You and Greg are taking Jake scuba diving.
 No, that's the thing.
 Greg and I have decided not to see each other.
 So if you haven't made any plans, you can have Jake.
 Oh, yeah, yeah.
 I'd love to have him.
 And I'm sorry to hear about you and Greg.
 - Thank you.
 - Is there anything I can do? Yeah, you can wipe that smirk off your face.
 - Okay.
 Well Well, bye.
 - Bye.
 She broke up with Greg She broke up with Greg She broke up with Greg - Alan? - Yeah? Peephole.
 - Hey.
 - Where have you been? Car wash.
 They found something real interesting in the back seat.
 Oh, yeah, what? Okay, now you're just showing off.
 No, Alan, I'm not.
 Although I have to admit, that is a sexy little item.
 - It is, isn't it? - Yeah, yeah.
 I'd like to meet the lady who fills this.
 Actually, you know her.
 - Oh, really? Lisa? - No.
 - Jennifer? - Who's Jennifer? Oh, right.
 No.
 Well, then who? I can tell you, but once I do, I can't untell you.
 - What are you talking about? - Who borrowed my car last weekend? Holy mother of God.
 No.
 No.
 Unholy mother of us.
 Mom in a car? Mom in my car.
 If I'd known this was gonna happen, I'd have gotten the vinyl seats.
 Wait.
 You're not just gonna leave it in the middle of the floor, are you? Really creeps you out, doesn't it? - No.
 - Then pick it up.
 Hello? Oh, oh, hi, Jake.
 What's up? Slow down there.
 Yeah.
 No, I know your mom broke up with Greg.
 Yes.
 I understand that you're very upset, but Well, no, no.
 I can't come over there and pick you up just because you're mad at your mother.
 Well I'm sorry, that's just the way it is.
 Now, why don't you let me speak to her.
 Yeah, Judith, hi.
 Look, I am trying to back you up here.
 No, I told him he had to work it out with you.
 No, no Really? You think it would be better if he came over here to cool off? Okay, but Well, bring him over, then.
 Well No, I'll see you in a bit.
 - Jake's coming over? - Yeah, yeah.
 Apparently he's furious with his mother about this Greg thing.
 Well, that's understandable.
 He was just getting to know this amazing guy who had a boat and a pool and a Hummer.
 A guy who could teach him all sorts of cool stuff.
 And then his mother just rips this wonderful man out of his life.
 Too soon? Hello.
 Everybody decent? Oh, hi, Mom.
 What a surprise.
 Well, I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd drop by and see how my sons are getting along.
 - Well, we're doing fine.
 - Yep, just fine.
 - Good.
 Jake? - He's He's fine.
 Just dandy.
 Oh, the hell with it.
 I left a $300 bra in the back seat of your Mercedes, and I want it back.
 Oh, my.
 How in heaven's name did that happen, Mother? - Well, if you must know - I don't need to know.
 Oh, Alan, grow up.
 I sold a 12-million-dollar house and I wanted to celebrate.
 With the Saudi prince? Don't be ridiculous.
 He's got nine wives and they're all like 11 years old.
 No, I was with the seller's realtor.
 Splitting that juicy commission made us both so hot we barely made it off the front lawn.
 Now, go get Mommy's bra.
 Oh, darling, that is just sick.
 Seek help.
 Hey.
 - Hey, what's going on? - My mom broke up with Greg.
 I heard.
 I'm gonna live here with you and Dad from now on.
 Wanna bet? - Why not? - Two reasons: Your mother loves you, and life is cruel.
 Wait, that may just be one reason.
 Well, maybe my dad can talk my mom into getting back together with Greg.
 Enjoy fifth grade, kid.
 You're obviously gonna be there for a while.
 What am I supposed to do, Alan? I know how much he liked Greg but that can't be the reason for me to keep seeing him.
 I understand.
 You're not wrong here.
 I'm not? Because I certainly feel wrong.
 I failed as a wife.
 I'm failing as a mother.
 I even blew it as a lesbian.
 That might have been the problem.
 You're not a failure.
 We're both at fault for the marriage not working.
 You're a great mother.
 And I'm sure you would have made a heck of a lesbian if you just hung in there a little longer.
 I'm gonna take Jake out so you guys can talk.
 - Thank you.
 - Thanks, Charlie.
 - Where we going? - I gotta trade in my car.
 Why are you trading this car in? Didn't you just get it? Yeah, but there's a banging noise that's driving me crazy.
 I don't hear anything.
 You're not in my head.
 Hey, as long as you're getting rid of it, mind if I take it for a little spin? Get real.
 I promise I'll go really slow.
 Forget it.
 It's not gonna happen.
 Is that a footprint up there? I never should have brought Jake into the relationship.
 It was too soon.
 Don't be too hard on yourself.
 So Greg didn't turn out to be the great guy you thought he was gonna be.
 Oh, he was a great guy.
 My God, Alan, he took my breath away.
 Our first night together he picked me up and carried me to bed in his arms.
 Well, the point is you brought Jake into the relationship too soon.
 Greg said I was too demanding.
 I am, aren't I? - I am a demanding, angry shrew.
 - Hey, hey.
 Don't say that.
 That That is not who you are.
 That's just who you've become.
 But, you know, underneath it all I can still see the frightened, neurotic girl with the minor eating disorder that I fell in love with.
 Oh, Alan.
 I don't get it.
 This is exactly like your other car.
 No, it's not.
 Listen.
 No banging.
 Well, I think you should have gotten a cool car like Greg.
 Hey, do yourself a favor and stop worshiping this dude.
 There's a guy in your life who's worth looking up to and modeling yourself after.
 - Dad? - Okay, two guys.
 Well, I still don't understand why my mom had to break up with Greg.
 It could have been worse.
 She could have married him and then broken up.
 When I was your age, I was already on my third stepfather.
 And I kind of liked the second one.
 Well, how did you feel? How do you think I felt? I was pissed off.
 - Yeah, well, so am I.
 - And I'm not saying you shouldn't be but you can't blame your mother.
 She's gotta do what's right for her.
 - You understand? - I guess.
 Good.
 The next time you see her, give her a big hug and let her know that there's still one guy who's willing to live with her.
 Okay.
 Wait, you blame your mom for everything.
 That's different.
 My mom's Satan.
 Come on, let's go boat shopping.
 If I'm old enough to drive I'm old enough to know what's going on with you and Mom.
 You're not old enough to drive.
 I don't believe that you were carrying her because she twisted her ankle.
 Believe what you want.
 That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
 Tell him, Charlie.
 Your parents were about to have sex when we walked in.
 Yeah, right.
 






                    			- Have any homework this weekend? - A little.
 Why don't you get started on it tonight.
 But it's only Friday.
 I know, but if you do it tonight, you won't worry.
 I'm not worried.
 Hey.
 What are you guys up to tonight? - Jake's gonna do his homework.
 - Why? It's only Friday.
 Let me tell you something about Charlie.
 He was a lousy student.
 He always put off doing his homework and his grades reflected it.
 - Seems like he's doing okay now.
 - Go get your books.
 - I left my books at Mom's.
 - Fine.
 I'll have her bring them over.
 - Okay.
 They're in my bag.
 Go get them.
 Okay.
 Well, don't wait up.
 - Pretty confident, huh? - Yeah.
 Thus, the "don't wait up.
" Didn't you meet this girl a couple of days ago? Yup.
 So tonight's the night.
 You know, the three-day rule.
 That's the three-date rule.
 Three dates? That's crazy talk.
 All right.
 If you bring her back here, please be discreet.
 Don't worry.
 First night's always at her place.
 - Is that another rule? - No.
 It's just a common courtesy.
 A woman's more relaxed and comfortable in her own surroundings.
 Plus, the minute she falls asleep, I can hit the bricks.
 That's lovely.
 It's a shame you don't work for Hallmark.
 Yeah, I'll bet those guys get laid like crazy.
 - Goodnight, buddy.
 - Night.
 What happened to my chicken nuggets? What are you talking about? You ate them.
 Now, stop procrastinating and do your homework.
 What does procrastinating mean? It means putting off stuff that you have to do.
 - Can you use it in a sentence? - I just did.
 Oh, yeah.
 Did I tell you a bug flew in my ear today? Charlie? - You asleep? - What? No.
 No.
 You? Listen, I have to get up early tomorrow, so - You want me to leave? - Do you mind? No, I'm cool either way: Stay or go.
 Okay.
 So I'm going? Thanks, you're a doll.
 You know, I actually prefer waking up in my own bed.
 Personal little quirk.
 - You don't mind, right? - Not at all.
 Good.
 So this worked out well for all concerned, huh? It was fantastic.
 We'll have to do it again.
 Absolutely.
 - But not tonight? - No.
 - Okay.
 Well, I'll call you.
 - It's probably easier if I call you.
 Sure.
 Either way.
 - I call you, you call me.
 - I'll call you.
 Good.
 - So I guess I'll just let myself out.
 - Okay.
 Sherri, you asleep? Finally.
 - How was school this week? - Okay.
 - Any homework for the weekend? - Nope.
 - Really? - Okay, yes.
 Do we have to go through this every Friday? I'd rather we didn't.
 Curly fries.
 When I was your age, we didn't even have curly fries.
 We had to make do with straight or crinkle cut.
 - What? - I'm just trying to distract you while I steal your fries.
 - Hey.
 Jake, don't be selfish.
 Let him have one.
 So no date tonight? I thought I'd just hang with you guys.
 - What about that girl you're seeing? - Sherri? I'm playing that slow.
 Really? Do you mean at a leisurely pace or as if you were developmentally challenged? Oh, aren't you clever? Bite me.
 Alan, most beautiful women are used to guys chasing after them.
 They expect it.
 Squeeze a little more ketchup on it, would you, buddy? However, if you hang back and stay cool the women come to you.
 Well, not to you specifically, but you get the theory.
 Yeah, I'm not stupid.
 Just physically repellent and inherently unlovable.
 Don't get snippy with me.
 I'm trying to teach you something.
 Hey, I agreed to one.
 If you're finished with dinner, get started on homework.
 I'm still hungry.
 He ate all my fries.
 You can have ice cream when you've done your homework.
 Isn't that procrastinating? Go.
 Man, that kid guards his plate like a one-armed inmate, doesn't he? Hello? Oh, hey, Sherri.
 How's it going? Tonight? No, I'm sorry, I can't.
 I've already got plans.
 How about tomorrow night? Oh, you've got plans.
 Okay.
 Well, Sunday? Monday? What about Tuesday? You know what? I'm looking at the wrong month in my date book.
 Tonight works.
 How about I pick you up at 8? Okay, I'll meet you at 7.
 How about Antonio's? The Oak Room it is.
 See you soon.
 - What just happened? - You were playing it slow.
 - Everything okay? - No, perfect, Stephan.
 Thanks.
 Always good to see you.
 I liked it too.
 So you must be a regular here.
 Yeah.
 Food's good and I bring a lot of clients.
 Speaking of which, it's getting kind of late.
 - I've got an early meeting tomorrow.
 - I'll get the check.
 I already took care of it.
 - When? - You were in the little boys' room.
 - That's not right.
 - It's fine.
 I asked you out.
 No big deal.
 No, you shouldn't call it "the little boys' room.
" - Sorry.
 - You're forgiven.
 So we can just go.
 If it's okay, I wanna go back to my place.
 Oh, great.
 I'll follow you.
 I don't think so, Charlie.
 I'm kind of tired.
 Okay.
 Well, how about this? I'll drive you home, carry you upstairs, tuck you into bed kiss you good night, and just as you're drifting off to sleep I will lick your body from head to toe.
 Lovely as that sounds, I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
 Okay.
 Yeah, I guess it is getting kind of late.
 - It's almost 9.
 - Thanks for understanding.
 - Sure.
 Hey, we're okay, right? - Yeah.
 - Did I say something to upset you? - No.
 - Are you mad at me? - No.
 - Promise? - Yes.
 Do I sound like a big old girl? Why didn't you do this part? That's extra credit.
 You don't have to do it.
 - Why don't you do it anyway? - Because I don't have to.
 It shows that you're willing to make an extra effort.
 But I'm not.
 - Do it anyway.
 - Why? If you spent as much time doing the work as you do arguing about it, we'd be done.
 I am done.
 This is extra.
 - Hey.
 - Hey.
 You're home early.
 Alan, if you got something to say why don't you just come out and say it? You're home early? Yeah, that's smart.
 Keep pushing me.
 - Did you see that? - Yeah, he took my ice cream.
 Hey, neighbor.
 Hi, Rose.
 - Didn't you have dessert with Sherri? - How did you know I was with Sherri? Oh, Charlie, you still don't get me, do you? - So do you wanna talk about it? - No.
 She probably just had to get up early, like she said.
 Probably.
 Unless her real date didn't start until later and she just didn't wanna eat alone.
 What? Oh, come on, Charlie.
 Double-booking.
 You practically invented it.
 No, she wouldn't do that to me.
 Why would she do that to me? Did she do that to me? She did that to me, didn't she? - Excuse me? - Sorry.
 I was just taking a little selfish delight in your pain.
 The Germans call it "schadenfreude" but here in the U.
S.
A.
, we just go: - Thanks.
 - Oh, Charlie you don't need a girl like that.
 You could do so much better.
 You're right.
 I can.
 She doesn't call when she says she will.
 She won't let me sleep over.
 She's obviously seeing other guys.
 So why can't I get her out of my head? Okay, that's not where I was going, but let's review: She's gorgeous, but she's also self-centered she's promiscuous, she's commitment-phobic - Oh, my God.
 - What? I'm dating myself.
 No wonder the sex is so good.
 Trust me.
 You'll feel better having this done.
 - We'll have the weekend to have fun.
 - What if we don't have fun? Then all this studying will be for nothing.
 That's just a risk we'll have to take.
 Now, what year did Magellan circumnavigate the globe? - It's not gonna be on the test.
 - Maybe not.
 It wouldn't hurt for you to know it.
 Why would I wanna know something I don't have to? Because maybe you'll need to know it in the future.
 Well, then, that's when I'll learn it.
 Why can't you just learn it now? There's only so much space in my brain that if you put Magellan in there, I might forget my locker combination.
 - Charlie, help me out here.
 - What? Jake doesn't think he needs to know anything about Magellan.
 What's Magellan? Okay, I'm out of here.
 Won't be late.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 Bad news from the clinic? No.
 I'm just taking Sherri out for a nice dinner after which I plan to gently but firmly extricate myself from the relationship.
 So she got bad news from the clinic? There's no bad news.
 There's no clinic.
 - I'm just ending it.
 - Why? Because she's a self-centered, manipulative narcissist.
 So are you.
 Hello.
 He said "narcissist.
" It's not a dirty word.
 What does it mean? If you wanna know, look it up in the dictionary.
 Okay.
 He's not coming back.
 - Thank you, Steven.
 - It's "Stephan.
" Sure, it is.
 Listen, Sherri, we need to talk.
 - You're a terrific woman, but - You look so hot tonight.
 Really? - That was incredible.
 - Yeah, it was, wasn't it? It's funny how things work out.
 An hour ago I wasn't feeling too good about us.
 I gotta get up early again tomorrow.
 So if you don't mind There you go, Elvis.
 Peanut butter and bananas.
 - My mom cuts it diagonally.
 - Yeah? Well, that's the way I learned to cut it in prison.
 Thank you? Alan, got a riddle for you: What's short, picky and only supposed to be here on weekends? I'll give you a hint: It's your kid.
 I know.
 I know.
 His mother decided she had to go to Palm Springs to rejuvenate herself.
 Detox? No, a health spa.
 Six hundred dollars a day for meditation and colonics.
 How in the hell do you meditate when someone's squirting water up your business? I don't think they happen simultaneously, Berta.
 That's good, because it could be very distracting.
 I can't even pee when the cat's watching me.
 Nobody answer the phone! Please, let it be her.
 Please, please, please.
 No, wait.
 Berta, you answer it.
 No, no, no! Let it ring.
 No, answer it.
 - Harper residence.
 - I'm not here.
 - Yeah, he's here.
 - Okay, I'm here.
 Jake, it's your mother! So how's it going down there? You struck oil yet? Charlie, what is going on with you? - What? - What do you mean, "what"? You're spending half your time drinking and moping.
 The other half sleeping and throwing up.
 You haven't been out of the house all week.
 You want me to go out like this in public? If you feel so strongly about this girl, why don't you just call her? Yeah, sure, I could call her.
 I could also FedEx her my testicles in a little silk bag.
 All the more reason to call first and give her a heads-up.
 Alan, don't you understand? This isn't about dating anymore.
 It's not even about sex.
 It's about self-respect and pride.
 Yeah, well, I think that ship has sailed, Charlie.
 See, the problem is she doesn't need me.
 So I need to figure out a way to show her that I don't need her just as much as she doesn't need me.
 But without seeming needy.
 You see my dilemma? Actually, I think I do.
 You feel like I felt when Judith kicked me out.
 All right, if you're gonna mock me, this conversation's over.
 - Who took my sandwich? - Go do your homework.
 Unbelievable.
 - I'm glad you were free tonight.
 - I'm glad I was home when you called.
 I would've called sooner, but it's been a crazy week.
 It's okay.
 I understand.
 - Oh, Charlie, I want you.
 - Are you sure? - Oh, yeah.
 - How much? - Can't you tell? - I wanna hear it.
 I need you.
 I ache for you.
 Okay, then.
 - What are you doing? - I've gotta get home.
 I got an early meeting.
 - What? - Beat you to it this time, didn't I? What are you talk? What kind of game are you playing here? The same game you're playing, only tonight, I win.
 Really? What is it that you're winning? Charlie, I'm lying here hungry for your body and you're walking away.
 So, what exactly is it that you're winning? You know.
 - Get out.
 - It's too late.
 You can't kick me out.
 I already said I'm leaving.
 Hey.
 - So how'd it go? - Great.
 I took control.
 I regained my self-respect.
 I walked out of there with my head held high.
 Good for you.
 Good for you.
 So you're done beating yourself up? Not quite.
 Jake, wait till we get inside.
 I'm hungry.
 Uncle Charlie's in there.
 I see your point.
 At the risk of asking a foolish question you got any homework this weekend? - Nope.
 Did it at school.
 - Really? - Yup.
 Did it during detention.
 - Jake, why did you have detention? Because I didn't do my homework yesterday.
 So you did yesterday's homework and today's homework? Yup.
 The extra-credit section and everything.
 - Oh, great.
 I'll look it over.
 - Okay, I didn't do it.
 - Jake, why do you keep lying? - Because I thought you trusted me.
 The detention part was true.
 Hi, Charlie.
 Hey, Rose.
 What's going on? I just stopped by to say I'm sorry things didn't work out with you and Sherri.
 - Yeah.
 Thanks.
 And I'm sorry for my schadenfreude the other day.
 I've been riddled with "glaukenschtuken" ever since.
 - Glauken? - Schtuken.
 It means: " Feeling guilty for having felt schadenfreude.
" - They've got a word for that? - Not yet.
 But I'm hoping "glaukenschtuken" catches on.
 I'll do my part.
 You know, something good did come out of all this: Watching you obsess over Sherri really helped me understand my obsession for you.
 I mean, you never return my calls.
 You always see other women.
 You never knowingly let me sleep over.
 And yet, I've never been able to get you out of my head.
 - Interesting.
 - Isn't it? But now that I understand it, I feel somehow free of it.
 Well, that's great, Rose.
 It sounds like a real healthy breakthrough.
 Yeah.
 And the best part is now that the fog of obsession has lifted I can stop idealizing you, and see you for who you really are.
 And who would that be? An emotionally scarred and deeply flawed human being.
 Who will one day bless me with emotionally scarred and deeply flawed children.
 Rose.
 Just hold me.
 I like the names Mike and Trudy.
 






                    			- So, dear - What? Do you see anything you like? I don't know.
 What's venison? - Deer.
 - What? - Deer.
 - What? Deer.
 D-E-E-R.
 What? W-H-A-T.
 What's wrong with him? Jake, it's It's the deer in the forest, like Like Bambi.
 Oh, cool, let's eat Bambi.
 Coming soon to pay-per-view.
 Mom, wha? What are you doing? - Nothing.
 - Oh, that's stealing.
 Hardly.
 I'm paying $ 12 for a martini.
 They're lucky I don't take a chair.
 - You're paying? - Figure of speech, Charles.
 Can I take this? - No.
 - Oh, come on.
 My precious.
 Put it down.
 We do not take things that don't belong to us.
 Listen who's taking the moral high ground, Mr.
 Five-Finger Discount.
 - What does that mean? - It doesn't mean anything.
 - How do you want your venison? - Does it come with antlers? Alan, there's no reason your son can't learn from your mistakes.
 I didn't make a mistake, Mom.
 Unbelievable.
 Twenty-five years later and he still denies shoplifting.
 Oh, I get it.
 Five-finger discount.
 Cool.
 I did not shoplift, Jake.
 It was a misunderstanding.
 Alan, please.
 Walking around a toy store with your brother and the Silly Putty just jumped in your pocket? Yes.
 Not much of a lie, Dad.
 Okay, everybody ready to order? Is that why you won't let me have Silly Putty? It's a stupid, pointless toy.
 But why'd you steal it? I didn't.
 The security guard must have planted it on me to make a bust.
 Oh, Alan.
 Who in their right mind would plant Silly Putty on a 9-year-old boy? Who, indeed? - Hey, Jake, you ever eaten snails? - Yeah, sure.
 I mean, in a restaurant.
 Oh, no.
 - You okay? - No.
 That deer didn't have antlers when I ate it, but it's sure coming out that way.
 Well, you'll feel better tomorrow.
 We should sue that restaurant.
 Well, I'll get right on it.
 Come on.
 - Dad? - Yeah.
 Did you ever steal a car? I never stole anything.
 It's okay.
 You could tell me.
 I already know you got a rap sheet.
 For the last time, I did not take that Silly Putty.
 But the experience did teach me a very important lesson.
 And you know what that was? If you get caught, stick to your story, no matter how lame it is? - No, the lesson was - Hang on, Dad.
 Okay, go ahead.
 The lesson was Oh, God, Jake.
 That's That's awful.
 Yeah, I wish I could have saved that one for school.
 - You too? - Yeah.
 Apparently Mom wasn't the only parasite at dinner tonight.
 Hey how much do you remember about the whole Silly Putty incident? Oh, gee, not too much.
 I recall you crying when they dragged you into the store manager's office.
 Then I went and got a corn dog and an Orange Julius.
 Boy, those were good.
 - Remember those? - No, I mean did you see me take the Silly Putty? Oh, no, no, I was nowhere near the Silly Putty.
 I think I was in the doll section, taking a peek under Barbie's dress.
 What a gyp that was.
 If Jake had been caught shoplifting and told me the story I told there's no way I'd believe him.
 Well, let's just hope he doesn't get caught.
 - Can I tell you a little secret? - Okay.
 I always knew it wasn't the security guard.
 Really? There's only one rational explanation for how the Silly Putty got in my pants.
 And what would that be? That I actually stole it, but my mind couldn't deal with it.
 So somehow, I blocked it out.
 The human brain, huh? You gotta love it.
 That happens, right? You do something horrible and wake up with no recollection? - Oh, yeah.
 And yet there she is, lying right next to you.
 You know, that day changed my life.
 I mean, ever since, I've had to be on guard against Bad Alan.
 I'm sorry, "Bad Alan"? Yeah, it's It's what I call my potential for evildoing.
 - Oh, God.
 - It's why I've always worked so hard to be a good son, a good student, a good person.
 And you've succeeded.
 You are good, good, good.
 Well, sure, I turned out great, but at what cost? I mean, do you have any clue how tightly wrapped I've had to be to keep Bad Alan in check? I get glimpses.
 Well, I suppose I should count my blessings that I was stopped.
 Who knows what kind of monster I would've become if I hadn't been caught with the putty.
 But what if the security guard did plant it on you? That would mean there's no Bad Alan.
 That's true.
 But I can't afford to take that chance.
 None of us can.
 He's fine.
 Hey, Charlie.
 Hey, Rose.
 Looks like somebody needs a shoulder to cry on.
 No, thank you.
 Wanna just make out then? - Rose - You're right.
 That was out of line.
 I deserve a spanking.
 Okay, what's up? - Can I trust you with something? - You trust me with your bank account number.
 I never gave you my bank account number.
 Right, right.
 Go on.
 Have you ever done anything so wrong, so horrible? Oh, yeah.
 - Let me finish.
 - I'm sorry.
 Something that seemed harmless at the time yet somehow managed to mess up someone's entire life? Good question.
 I think it's too early to say.
 Go on.
 Well, I have.
 Twenty-five years ago, I put Silly Putty in my brother's pants.
 Well, if you left it in the egg, it should still be good.
 My point is, everybody thought he stole it and I never told him the truth.
 Now you're wracked with guilt and not sure whether a confession will make things better or worse.
 Yes, exactly.
 That's a sexy feeling, isn't it? Come on, Rose.
 You want my advice, Charlie? God help me, yes.
 Take your secret to the grave but leave a manuscript explaining every questionable act you've committed in a safety-deposit box with instructions for it to be opened at your death and read in front of all your friends, relatives and former lovers.
 I like it.
 Good.
 Now we can relax and enjoy the evening.
 Sing it with me, Charlie.
 Three, four, five, six, seven.
 - Are you decent? - Yeah.
 Three, four, five, six, seven.
 What's up? - Nothing.
 Just came in to say good night.
 - Three, four, five, six, seven.
 Why? Three, four, five, six, seven.
 Nothing.
 You just seemed stressed out before, and I was concerned.
 Oh, thanks.
 You're a You're a good brother.
 Three, four, five, six, seven.
 You do that every night? Are you kidding? After every meal.
 Three, four, five, six, seven.
 You are tightly wrapped, aren't you? The price of healthy gums is eternal vigilance.
 Oh, God, I can't do this anymore.
 - Do what? - I have to tell you something.
 - Okay.
 - Come on out in the bedroom.
 All right.
 - What you doing? - You'll understand in a minute.
 - I thought you had to tell me something.
 - I do.
 There is no Bad Alan.
 I stole the Silly Putty and put it in your pocket when you weren't looking.
 - Three, four, five, six, seven.
 - Damn you to hell! Come out here and die like a man! What do you know, there is a Bad Alan.
 Hey, Dad, when you got arrested for shoplifting, did they take you to jail? I did not get arrested, and there was no jail.
 So I guess you never had to shank a guy to get your props in the yard.
 You cracked the parental code on the cable box again.
 It's 1-2-3-4.
 A monkey could crack that.
 - Good morning.
 - Morning.
 Why are you walking like that? I spent the night in the bathroom.
 You too, huh? Tell Jake what you told me last night.
 Oh, okay.
 Sure.
 Jake, your father didn't steal the Silly Putty.
 - I did.
 - Really? Yeah, I stuck it in his pocket, so if anything happened he'd be the one to get in trouble.
 What do you think now, Jake? I think Uncle Charlie's a genius.
 What? No, no.
 No genius.
 No, no.
 I mean, it's the perfect crime.
 How did you think of that? I don't know.
 I saw the putty.
 Your dad was wearing those dorky chinos with the big pockets.
 - And a light just went off in my head - Charlie.
 A bad light.
 A bad, evil light.
 Because stealing is wrong and letting somebody else take the blame for it is worse.
 Yeah, so Dad was like a decoy.
 Well, technically, the term is "mule.
" - Mule? Why? - Because he carries stuff.
 - Oh, of course - Okay, okay.
 The important thing is, your father never stole in his life.
 And your Uncle Charlie is a thief and a coward.
 Yeah, but you're a mule.
 Are you happy? Go get dressed and washed.
 - Can we go to the mall? - Why do you wa? No.
 I need to get a different mule.
 Okay, can we please get past this? No.
 No, we can't.
 I feel betrayed and hurt in ways that I can't even express.
 And you think we can just dance past that? I was hoping.
 Well, I am sorry, but it is not that easy.
 I mean, thanks to you, my My life has been twisted beyond recognition.
 I mean, look at me, Charlie.
 I'm a I'm a broke, hopelessly neurotic, middle-aged man who doesn't know who he is or where he belongs.
 I have nothing, Charlie.
 - No No wife, no home, nothing.
 - Okay.
 So should I check back with you after lunch? What do you want me to do? I said I was sorry.
 L I confessed to Jake.
 And I doubt I got more than six, seven hours sleep last night.
 Nothing you can do.
 The damage has been done.
 - It can't be undone.
 - Come on, I'm your brother.
 - You're gonna forgive.
 You always do.
 - No, no, this is different.
 - This is the worst thing you've ever done.
 - No, it's not.
 What do you mean? Just making conversation.
 - Hey, Mom.
 - Charlie, what are you doing here? - In the neighborhood.
 Thought I'd visit.
 - Why? - I don't know.
 I'm your son.
 - And? - And I was hoping we could talk.
 - About? May I please just come in? Are you fleeing from the law? - I'm not fleeing from anyone, Mom.
 - Well, keep it in mind.
 No one would ever think to look for you at your mother's house.
 - I get your point.
 I don't visit enough.
 - You don't visit at all.
 And I'm riddled with guilt.
 Oh, you're just saying that to make me feel better.
 So, what's up? You know how the other night at dinner we were talking about the Silly Putty deal? Did that venison disagree with you? Yeah, that's not what I came to talk about.
 I've got a good mind to sue that restaurant.
 - Yeah, anyway, about the Silly Putty - What about it? Alan didn't steal it.
 I did.
 I put it in his pocket.
 You framed your baby brother? How could you? I know, I know.
 It was a rotten thing to do.
 Rotten? It's unspeakable.
 Do you have any idea what you put me through? - You? - First the embarrassment of people thinking that I'd spawned a petty thief.
 Then all the trouble I went to trying to figure out clever ways to hide my jewelry from his sticky little fingers.
 - That's really not what l - Not to mention the hundreds of hours spent driving him to therapy with that creepy Dr.
 Demerest while I could have been I don't know, doing something fun.
 Okay, yeah, it was a real imposition on you and as it turns out, it had kind of a negative impact on Alan too.
 Alan? Oh, yes, of course.
 You know, there was no insurance for kleptomania therapy in those days.
 It was all out of pocket.
 Yeah, but about Alan I was hoping you might have insight as to how I could get him to forgive me.
 Why ask me? You know, I'm starting to wonder that myself.
 I guess it's because he still loves you despite all the lousy stuff you did to him.
 I beg your pardon? I was a wonderful mother.
 And if Alan thinks otherwise it's only because that walleyed Dr.
 Demerest put ideas into his head.
 Well, that was money well spent.
 Okay, then.
 I didn't need a reason to drink tonight, but it's nice to know I've got one.
 Hey, Charlie, wait.
 - What? - Have you forgotten why you came here? You want forgiveness, right? - Yes.
 - Well I forgive you.
 But next time, call first.
 Would you pass the salt? Could you get me the salt? - Dad, salt.
 - Sure.
 - Here.
 - Thanks.
 Oh, would you give me the ketchup, please? Here.
 Here's the ketchup.
 Thank you.
 - Dad? - Yeah.
 If Uncle Charlie let you kick him in the nuts would that make you guys even? No.
 Boy, he's really mad at you.
 Relax, Jake.
 We're just having a little communication problem.
 That's what Dad said right before Mom threw him out.
 Nobody threw me out.
 Your mother and I mutually decided that we weren't compatible.
 You don't seem compatible with Uncle Charlie right now.
 - Well, it's not my fault.
 - Was it your fault with Mom? No.
 You know, Dad, maybe you're the one who's not compatible.
 If you're done with dinner, do your homework.
 Fine, kill the messenger.
 - Oh, come on, Alan.
 Talk to me.
 - No.
 Look, I wanna make this right, but you gotta help me.
 Please, tell me what I can do.
 I'm begging for your forgiveness.
 I am sorry, but you did something which affected my life in a deeply destructive way and l I don't think I have it in me to forgive you.
 - Hello? Anybody home? - In here, Mom.
 Well, how are my boys doing this evening? Well, I think Mommy has the answer.
 Alan if you find it intolerable living under the same roof with the brother who betrayed you then you and Jake can come and live with me.
 We're good.
 Hey, Charlie, a couple of days ago you said the Silly Putty wasn't the worst thing you ever did to me.
 It's ancient history.
 Let it go.
 I know, I know.
 It's just I'm curious.
 What else have you done to me that I didn't know about? - It's not important.
 - Yes, it is.
 The truth about the shoplifting incident it's allowed me to reevaluate who I am and And feel better about myself.
 - Well, that's great.
 - Yeah.
 I feel a lot better since I confessed.
 Good, good.
 So let's keep going with this.
 Okay, but you gotta promise that no matter what I tell you, all is forgiven.
 Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
 You're probably gonna laugh.
 - I'm sure I will.
 Tell me.
 - Well remember how you were a bed wetter till you were 8? Yeah.
 You actually stopped at 6.
 Wha? What? What did you do? Did you sneak into my room and? And? And pour warm water on me while I was asleep? Yeah, okay, let's say it was water, and let's say I poured it.
 Well, I feel better.
 How about you?   






                    			- Hey, look who's here.
 - Hey, Dad.
 Aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye? Apparently not.
 Do you see how rude he is to me? It's terrible.
 I'll talk to him.
 - I wish you would because Wait, Alan! - Oh, oh, sorry.
 Alan, have you been badmouthing me? - Badmouthing you? To whom? - To Jake.
 Oh, to Jake.
 No.
 - Why? - His attitude towards me is disrespectful.
 I have to wonder where he's getting it from.
 I assure you, I make it a point to speak well of you in front of our son.
 What about your brother? Oh, with Charlie, I'm completely honest.
 That is not what I meant.
 I know.
 Hey, Judith.
 Have you said derogatory things about me to Jake? No, why? Did you want me to? I don't understand his behavior.
 Ignoring me, avoiding me, acting like I'm the enemy.
 But you get why I'm doing it, right? I got it! I don't know what to say.
 He's not getting it from us.
 - Absolutely not.
 - It's your mother! - You talk to her.
 - No, I talked last time.
 - Choose you for it.
 - Odds.
 One, two, three, shoot.
 - Odds.
 You talk to her.
 - No.
 - Hey, but you said you were gonna - I lied.
 Leave a message at the beep.
 Beep! I wish there were a better way to deal with Mom.
 There is, but we're both too pretty for jail.
 - What? - What? Mom's here.
 Charlie, did you hear me? Yeah, I just prefer to live in denial.
 Come on.
 We talked about this.
 We need to set an example.
 Fine, tell Mom I love her and I don't wanna give her my cold.
 That is not going to help.
 Well, you gotta say it in front of Jake.
 No.
 Here is the plan.
 We'll stop acting like we hate being with her stop taking shots at her, and start acting like we love and respect her.
 - All at once? - Come on.
 Your Uncle Charlie thinks I don't see him but Grandmommy sees everything.
 Mom, we didn't expect to see you today.
 I have to come unannounced because when I call first there's no one home when I get here.
 I imagine that's only because my cowardly sons are trying to avoid me.
 She's ruining the plan.
 Well, the important thing is we're all here, and we're happy to see you.
 - Right, Charlie? - Oh, happy isn't the word.
 - So, what's new, Mom? - Well, if you really care - We do, we do.
 - We do.
 Next Sunday, I am receiving my gold blazer from the Westside Realtor's Association.
 - I am so proud of you.
 - That's great.
 Me too, Mom.
 It's the highest honor the real-estate community can bestow.
 - I am so proud of you.
 - That's great.
 Me too, Mom.
 So I wanted to talk to you about the presentation ceremony.
 We'll be there.
 Tell us where and when.
 Well, next Sunday, 5:00.
 And I was hoping we could have it here.
 - Here? - Why here? - I mean, we love and respect you - But why here? This isn't really a good house for parties.
 - Yeah, it's so big and close to the ocean.
 - Yeah.
 Come on.
 I can't very well throw a party for myself.
 This way everyone will get to see how much my sons love and respect me.
 Anyway, here is the guest list, and also a suggested menu.
 Nothing fancy.
 Cocktails, buffet.
 Any questions? - No.
 - Good.
 Okay.
 Big kiss.
 Love you all.
 - Love you too, Mom.
 - Bye, Grandma.
 Relatives, huh? Can't live with them, can't turn them in for the reward.
 Excuse me, Berta, but we happen to love our mother very much.
 - Right, Charlie? - Right.
 Jake, look.
 There's a pelican on the deck.
 Oh, cool.
 Are you happy? Now we have to throw a party for your crazy-ass mother.
 - She's your mother too.
 - How do you know? - I could've been adopted.
 - You wish.
 I do.
 Now, what about this stupid party? Here.
 Maybe this'll help.
 "Daisy's Fishing Tackle and Live Bait"? Turn it over.
 "Daisy's Classy Catering.
" She's my sister.
 Her husband left.
 I'm trying to get her back on her feet.
 She runs a catering business and a bait shop? Not at the same time.
 There's no pelican.
 Hey, you Charlie? Maybe.
 - Who's asking? - I'm Daisy, the caterer.
 Your Berta's sister? Same mom.
 Dad's a little iffy.
 Berta said if I wanted a shot of your bourbon, I had to ask you.
 - Yeah, sure.
 Knock yourself out.
 - Thanks.
 I don't usually drink before noon, but I'm going through a rough patch.
 Well, that's why they make bourbon.
 My husband left me for another woman.
 You know how I found out? - To tell you the truth - Relax.
 It's rhetorical.
 They waved to me as they drove my house out of the trailer park.
 - That's sad.
 - Yeah.
 I had that doublewide 11 years.
 Larry was with me for four.
 Six months of those were house arrest, so you can't give him credit for that.
 You know, I haven't gotten up to pee yet.
 Let me tell you something.
 Larry was nothing when I met him.
 He was working at some kosher slaughterhouse out in Fontana before they fired him for being mean to the cattle.
 What? The Jewish laws dictate that the animals have to be treated kindly before they get whacked.
 Larry would taunt them.
 "Hey, hamburger, guess what's gonna happen to you.
" Anyway, I picked him up off his sorry, unemployed ass.
 I gave him hair plugs, contact lenses, teeth.
 The bastard dumped me for this tiny, little Korean manicurist who huffs nail-polish remover between appointments.
 Well, you give a guy hair and teeth, he's bound to hook up with trash.
 No, she was pretty hot.
 She had a spray-on tan, Botox up the yin-yang.
 Couldn't tell if she was 20 or 60.
 - Daisy! - In here! What the hell are you doing? Relax.
 It's not what you think.
 We're just having a drink.
 Good idea.
 You listen to me.
 Just because I got us this job doesn't mean I'm cooking by myself.
 I'm coming down there.
 And don't act like you're doing me some big favor.
 Oh, excuse me for trying to help my broke, homeless, baby sister.
 I'm not homeless.
 I have a home.
 I just don't know where it's parked.
 I wouldn't be broke if you'd have paid me my share of Mama's estate.
 What estate? It was a shoebox full of corn pads, used lottery tickets and insulin.
 It's the first I'm hearing about the insulin.
 Excuse me, but shouldn't we be, you know cooking something for my mother's party? Hang on, Charlie.
 You know, I am sick of you insinuating that I stole all that crap Mama left me.
 She didn't leave it to you.
 You were just the first one back after she flatlined.
 Oh, and where were you? At some ashram in Oregon? I was learning from my guru how to channel my spirit guide.
 Oh, please.
 You were humping a defrocked priest in the woods.
 How about stuffed mushrooms? Everybody loves those.
 You know, that's your problem your whole life.
 You chase after losers, take care of them, fix them up and then they hop on the first manicurist out of town.
 You're jealous because I've had love in my life.
 Yeah? You know what you got in your life now? Squat.
 No husband, no one to do your nails, and blocks where your house used to be.
 I swear to God.
 One more word and I'm gonna knock you on your keister! - Okay, okay, there's no reason - Squat! - That's it! - Whoa, whoa, no! No, whoa! Stop! Berta! Berta! Give me the rolling pin.
 Is there a special place you'd like me to put it? I don't know what else you want from me.
 I took you in.
 Gunther's in the garage, so you can have the couch.
 You spoil that dog.
 Anyway, I'm staying at a motel tonight.
 Good idea.
 Maybe you'll meet your next husband on the walk there.
 - Can I have one of these? - No.
 I am just trying to be a good sister.
 No, you're trying to make me feel like crap.
 It's what you always do.
 - So I can eat this? - No.
 - Let him have one.
 - You don't know this kid.
 He never stops at one.
 He eats like a refugee.
 - Eat it.
 - Drop it.
 Hey, how's it going? Not good.
 Nice move, Tinkerbell.
 - Shut your hole and help me pick this up.
 - You pick it up.
 I'm going outside to meditate.
 - What's going on? - I'll tell you what's going on.
 You wanted that clown to be nice to his mother.
 But did you think to say to him, "Clown, be nice to your mother"? No, we had to throw a big party for our mother catered by the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.
 That's it.
 I can't work like this.
 Well, you have to, Berta.
 We've got 50 people coming in a couple of hours.
 - Don't tell me.
 Tell her.
 - Fine.
 Watch this.
 Hey! I'm meditating here! Jake, let's go pick up Grandma.
 - Charlie, you're in charge.
 - The hell I am.
 - Why pick her up? - Grandma likes to drink.
 - When grownups drink, they don't drive.
 - Good thing Uncle Charlie lives here.
 So, good luck.
 I'll see you tomorrow.
 No, wait.
 Berta, you can't leave.
 Don't worry.
 Your deposit's fully refundable in fishing tackle or live bait.
 I don't want a refund.
 I want you to make up with Daisy so when my mother gets here, she'll have something to eat besides my soul.
 Make up with her? For what? Trying to help her? Trying to keep her from making the same stupid mistake again? Yeah, sure, fine, whatever.
 Just do it! No, I'm done with her.
 I quit.
 Berta Berta, you can't quit being related to somebody.
 Believe me, I've tried.
 She is a spoiled, little princess who doesn't know when somebody's trying to help.
 - And you know what else? - Hold on, hold on.
 I'm still trying to wrap my brain around "little princess.
" Ever since Mom spit her out, she got everything she wanted.
 "We don't need to fix Berta's teeth, Daisy needs singing lessons.
" "Why spend money on a prom dress for Berta when Daisy needs tap shoes?" - That's rough, but "Who cares if Berta needs her spine straightened?" "Daisy wants a nose job!" What if you went ahead and made a couple dozen of those little egg rolls? "So what if Berta's got an extra big toe?" - Mom? - Oh, hello, boys.
 Why aren't you dressed? We came to pick you up.
 So you can drink.
 Oh, yes, well, I've decided to pass on the party.
 What? You can't pass.
 We've got people coming, decorations, caterers.
 And that's how you're dressed? Beats the hell out of a bathrobe.
 - Why don't you wanna go to your party? - Please, it isn't a party.
 It's a sham.
 None of those people are my friends.
 Why would you think that? Believe it or not, Alan, your mother is a very sensitive woman and I can feel when people around me know that I hate them.
 Why did you want us to throw the party? Oh, why does anyone want a party? To feel superior while feigning humility.
 Don't touch that, Jake.
 Let me tell you something.
 The way you treat people is the way they treat you back.
 Miserable bastards.
 But putting that aside, you're getting a gold jacket today and we wanted to share that with you.
 Is that what it takes? I have to win an award for my sons to notice I'm alive? Okay, you know what? Go, don't go.
 I don't care.
 If you wanna sit here and stew in the venom and bile that is the soup of your being, then fine.
 I hope you drown in it.
 Don't you ever talk to your mother this way.
 Forget the party.
 I'll go back and tell those people that the guest of honor could not be bothered to show up.
 - Come on, Jake.
 - Oh, dear Lord.
 Alan, wait.
 If this silly, little party means that much to you, I'll go.
 Just let me get dressed.
 Oh, gee.
 Thanks, Mom.
 God, I hate being guilted into doing things.
 And after all that, the loans, the bail, the kidney I gave her which even though it wasn't mine, was still money out of pocket did she appreciate my sacrifices? I'm guessing no.
 She threw them away on chasing after men with drinking problems men with gambling problems, men with wooden legs and glass eyes.
 You wanna know why? Spare parts? Low self-esteem.
 I remember when we were little girls she had this crush on our cousin Jimmy - He wasn't really our cousin.
 He was - Stop, please! Enough.
 If you won't talk to her, I will.
 Finally.
 I was running out of stories.
 Daisy? Can I talk to you for a minute? Daisy is no longer inhabiting this earthly vessel.
 Excuse me? I am Oxyquatzal, warrior priestess of the Aztec people.
 Okay.
 Let me ask you something.
 Do you know how to make those little hot dogs wrapped in pastry? Listen carefully.
 I have a message for Daisy.
 - Really? - She's wandered off the path of destiny.
 She must return.
 Alrighty, is there a number where she can reach you? Tell her to follow her bliss to stop squandering the gifts of the Great Spirit.
 - Got it.
 - Do you need to write that down? No, I got it.
 Path, bliss, spirit.
 - Great Spirit.
 - Sorry.
 "Great Spirit.
" - Anything else? - No, that's it.
 - What do you want? - You're screwing with me, right? Get out of here.
 I'm trying to channel my spirit guide.
 OxyContin? Oxyquatzal.
 How do you know about her? Oh, boy.
 Berta! Was Oxyquatzal here? What did she say? She said that the guests are gonna be here soon so you should make up with your sister and finish cooking.
 No, she didn't.
 How do you know? Oxyquatzal is a 500-year-old Aztec warrior.
 Do you think she really cares about your dumb-ass party? Everybody likes a party.
 What did she really say, Chachi? She said that you have strayed from your path and to follow your bliss which is catering, right? - No, I never liked catering.
 I only got into it because the bait business was so damn competitive.
 What else? Something about squandering the gifts of the Great Spirit.
 Oh, man, that is heavy.
 For an ancient chick, she is so spot on.
 Well, no sense crying over squandered gifts.
 What do you say we go to the kitchen? What's the point? My life is hopeless.
 My dreams are dead.
 Yeah, but what if they weren't? - What do you mean? - Oh, I don't know.
 What if there was some way I could help you? You think you could whip up some rumaki then? You don't even know what my dreams are.
 Oh, come on.
 Work with me, baby.
 I don't even know what rumaki is! Oh, gosh, Alan, I don't know about this.
 - Is my hair all right? - Mom, your hair looks perfect.
 You're impeccably dressed, you're fashionably late and everybody is waiting for you.
 So, now, come on, let's walk in there and rub their noses in your success.
 Well, all right.
 - Alan.
 - What? You're blocking me.
 Rumaki? I will never, ever forgive you for this.
 One thing.
 One lousy thing I ask from my sons, and this is what I get.
 - Sorry.
 - Sorry.
 Not only was I roundly ignored at my own party but I listened to a disturbed caterer belt out the entire score of La Cage aux Folles.
 - Sorry.
 - Sorry.
 You should be sorry.
 We are.
 Then say it.
 - Sorry.
 - Sorry.
 Hello? Jake, honey, ready to go home? Mom, you're here.
 I love you.
 Wonderful.
 Teach him sarcasm.
 Thank you very much.
 - Sorry.
 - Sorry.
 






                    			- Hey, how do I look? - Incredible.
 All men want to be you, all women want to be with you.
 Could you at least look at me before you answer? I stand corrected.
 All men want to be with you Charlie, come on.
 I'm really nervous here.
 This is my first real date since college.
 - What the hell is this? - Bourbon.
 - You drink bourbon while you work out? - Gin makes me sweat.
 Look, don't turn this into a bigger deal than it needs to be.
 - You met a woman, you asked her out - Technically, she asked me out.
 See, I was in the market, and she needed advice on picking out corn.
 There were no employees around.
 There never are.
 Even if they are, they're not knowledgeable about produce.
 - Thank God you were there.
 - Tell me about it.
 I explained that you have to husk a few ears to check the firmness of the kernels.
 Next thing you know, she asked me out.
 Well, I guess that's why they say no one gets more action than a greengrocer.
 - They say that? - No.
 The point is, it's just dinner.
 You'll go, you'll bore her to death, you'll come home.
 Yeah, I know, but I wanna look good while I'm doing it.
 You look fine.
 Just relax.
 Be yourself.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 - You think I should bring some condoms? - Why? Well, I see the public service commercials Yeah, you're right.
 See you later.
 Feel the burn.
 I think it's going well.
 My God, Alan.
 You're like a machine.
 I'm a love shark, baby.
 If I stop making love, I drown.
 Okay, okay, okay.
 Wait a sec, wait a sec: Sharks don't growl.
 All right, I'm a love bear.
 If I stop making love, I prevent forest fires.
 Jeez.
 - Alan.
 - Put that out.
 - Morning.
 - Morning.
 I see you've been working out again.
 Yeah, well, it's good for my heart.
 I figure the liver damage makes it kind of a push.
 Morning, all.
 - Morning.
 - Morning.
 Thirsty.
 Alan.
 Well, gadzooks, Zippy's getting his freak on.
 Yeah, it seems we're living in an age of miracles.
 I guess if they can put a man on the moon they can put a woman on your brother.
 - Who's the girl? - I don't know.
 He met her at the supermarket.
 Helped her pick out corn.
 Corn? Well, I'm not in any position to judge.
 I once did a guy for a tank of gas.
 - Hey, Alan? Alan? - Yeah? - What you got there? - Basting brush chocolate sauce, rubber gloves.
 You know what we're gonna use them for? - No.
 - Neither do I.
 Charlie, I have never had sex like this before in my life.
 In fact, I don't think anything I've had prior to this can even be called sex.
 Because if you call that sex, we need a new name for this.
 My suggestion would be "hootenanny yum-yum.
" I'm happy for you.
 Me too.
 Oh, do we have a step stool? - Hallway closet.
 - Thank you.
 - You might wanna pace yourself.
 - Yeah, right.
 Oh, boy.
 - What? - Oh, boy.
 Can I watch TV? I don't see why not.
 You got eyes and a butt.
 Where's Alan? - He's here.
 - Well, may I speak with him? Sure, why not.
 Okay, okay.
 Wait a sec.
 - Ta-da! - Yes! Not a good time, Charlie.
 Well, I thought you might like to know that your ex-wife and son are here.
 She's supposed to bring him on Friday.
 It is Friday.
 But not until 5.
 It is 5.
 Okay, cover for me.
 I'll be right out.
 - Alan.
 - Yeah? You might wanna take off the rubber glove first.
 Good thinking.
 - He'll be right out.
 - Thank you.
 So how are you? What's going on in there? Alan's moving furniture around, because he's constantly redecorating.
 Sorry, I was taking a nap.
 So So, what's up? I wanted to remind you that Jake has his karate tournament tomorrow morning.
 - Okay.
 - What's that on your face? - Just a little chocolate sauce.
 - Thank you.
 Got it, karate tournament, tomorrow morning.
 Alan, what's going on? What's What's going on is I was lying in bed eating a sundae.
 - After moving furniture.
 - After moving furniture.
 And I fell asleep in some chocolate sauce.
 Goodbye, Alan.
 - I think she bought it.
 - You think? No.
 Why didn't you tell her you've got a woman? I don't know.
 It just seems wrong.
 You're divorced.
 You have nothing to feel guilty about.
 It's not guilt.
 It's more shame.
 - What are you ashamed of? - Charlie, I spent 12 years with Judith.
 We went through a lot together.
 You can't just erase all that by lapping chocolate sauce out of another woman's navel.
 Okay, my fault for asking.
 Now, what do you wanna do about Jake? Oh, my God, Jake's here.
 I don't want him to know I'm dating.
 This is not dating, Alan.
 This is rubber gloves and step stools.
 All right, all right.
 You distract him, and I'll sneak Nancy out and drive her home.
 - Fine.
 - Okay.
 Wrong.
 This is just wrong, so wrong.
 Hey, Jake, wanna go shoot some hoops? In a minute.
 He's oblivious.
 Just go.
 In a minute.
 No, he's still watching TV.
 Hold on, I'll check.
 - You hungry? - What are we having? - I don't know.
 Tell me if you're hungry.
 - That depends on what we're having.
 - Okay, what do you want? - What do you got? He's not hungry.
 So I thought you were taking her home and coming right back.
 You checked into a hotel? No, you're right, driving that way is dangerous.
 One pothole can change your life forever.
 When's the last time you ate something? Quit giggling, you know what I mean.
 Okay.
 Okay, look in the honor bar for some Gatorade or something.
 Dehydration is the enemy.
 All right, have fun.
 See you later.
 I am hungry.
 What's for dinner? - What do you want? - What do you got? I think there's a couple of steaks in the freezer.
 I want chicken.
 It's just wrong.
 So very, very wrong.
 - You full? - Yeah.
 - Good.
 - Why, what else we got? - You said you were full.
 - I am.
 Good.
 But what else we got? Sorry, I'm late.
 I had to go to the office for an emergency, and I got a flat tire.
 And so I had to wait for the auto club to come and change it.
 And I didn't have my card.
 And the guy had to check me on the computer even though I've been a member since 1989.
 And that's why it took until now for me to get back.
 Thought you were here.
 I missed you, Alan.
 Thank you.
 Can I speak with you for a minute? - Hey, Uncle Charlie, what's for dessert? - You said were full.
 Not for dessert.
 - Okay, what do you want? - What do you got? How do you not kill him? Charlie, I feel horrible about what I'm doing.
 Then you're doing it wrong.
 No, I feel like I'm abandoning my child.
 Weren't you listening? He didn't even notice you were gone.
 That's not the point.
 What kind of man chooses sex with an insatiably hot stranger over quality time with his little boy? I don't know, a man who was married for 12 years and had sex 12 times.
 You're right, I deserve this.
 Exactly, so go enjoy yourself.
 Well, I do have the room the whole night.
 Yeah, most of your better hotels prefer you do it that way.
 Just make sure Jake goes to bed early.
 He's got karate in the morning.
 - Which, of course, you'll be back for.
 - Charlie, trust me.
 You, I trust.
 It's him I'm worried about.
 What? Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
 I have to take him to karate? Alan, it's 6:30 in the morning.
 What kind of maniac broad did you hook up with? She's incredible, Charlie.
 I've never met anyone like her.
 Gotta go.
 Jake, wake up.
 Well, I tried.
 - Anybody home? - Right here.
 Where's Jake? I don't know.
 Didn't he have a karate tournament? Yes.
 You were supposed to take him three hours ago.
 - Why didn't you take him? - He wouldn't get up.
 I tried everything.
 What time did he go to bed? I don't know.
 I crashed around 2 and he was still going strong.
 He was up past 2? He said he's had coffee before, but that was a lie, right? Okay, okay, all right, it's not important.
 The karate was his mother's idea.
 Listen.
 I need to ask you for another favor.
 Oh, come on, put it in the holster, Wild Bill.
 No, no, no.
 This isn't about sex.
 I need you to watch Jake for the rest of the weekend so that Nancy and I can go to Vegas and get married.
 Oh, God, Alan.
 There's no need to marry the woman.
 If you don't wanna have sex anymore, just tell her.
 No, no, you don't understand.
 This is beyond sex.
 We're in love.
 Alan, come here.
 You are not in love, you're besotted.
 No, no, no, I have never felt like this about a woman before.
 We have a bond that transcends the physical.
 - Really? - Yeah.
 - Kind of a spiritual thing? - Yes.
 Okay.
 I can understand that.
 So where's she from? She's from around here.
 - Where? - Supermarket.
 Charlie, stop that.
 I have thought this through and I am really and truly in love with - Nancy.
 - I knew that.
 I knew that.
 I was looking for the proper adjective to describe her.
 Nuts? Easy? Limber? Charlie.
 Charlie, you started off on the wrong foot with my first wife.
 Do not make the same mistake with wonderful Nancy.
 Okay, you're right.
 This is not about her.
 Come here.
 Sit down.
 - You gonna hit me? - Well, let's see how it goes.
 Okay, look, I've never been much of a big brother to you.
 I didn't protect you.
 I wasn't around when you started dating when you got married and had Jake.
 You know why? - Why? - I was busy getting laid.
 Which makes me the perfect big brother to help you now.
 I've been through this.
 I know what it means to confuse sex with love.
 That's not what I'm doing, Charlie.
 We're talking about me, and I've been down this road many times.
 I remember this one girl.
 We had this unbelievably hot weekend together.
 It was like nothing I'd ever experienced before, and I proposed.
 - I begged her to marry me.
 - Wow, where did you meet? Detention.
 - This was in high school? - Eighth grade.
 And then years later, it happened again with a different woman.
 Instant chemistry.
 The sex was unbelievable.
 I was convinced we were soul mates, so I threw myself at her.
 I did everything to get her to marry me.
 And you know what? If she'd said yes I'd now have a 67-year-old ex-wife on a belly dancer's pension.
 So, what I'm trying to say is you're not the first guy to mistake passion for true love and you won't be the last.
 If someone had told me what I'm telling you I could have saved myself a lot of heartache.
 Okay.
 I hear you.
 Thank you.
 You're welcome.
 So make sure Jake doesn't fill up on junk food, and I'll call you from Circus Circus.
 Circus Circus? You're right, money should be no object.
 What's the hotel with the pirate show? I'm sorry, Alan, but I'm gonna have to knock you out.
 - Hello? - Mom, thank God you're here.
 Oh, I don't need your sarcasm, Charlie.
 No, I mean it.
 I need you.
 Alan needs you.
 What's going on? Alan, tell Mom your plans for the weekend.
 - No.
 - Why? Embarrassed? - No.
 No.
 - Ashamed? - Scared? - Yes.
 Sweetheart, I'm your mother.
 You can tell me anything.
 Okay.
 I met a wonderful woman in the supermarket a few days ago and we're getting married.
 I see.
 For God's sake, if you're that horny, find a nice call girl, put her on retainer.
 This is not about sex.
 Oh, please.
 What else could it be? - Well, it could be love.
 - Yeah.
 Sure.
 Who is this woman? What does she do? She does Alan.
 Okay, okay, that That is how it started but in the last day and a half it has blossomed into so much more.
 Oh, my randy little nincompoop.
 Listen, if I had gotten married after every weekend of hot, sweaty debauchery with a virtual stranger you'd have, well, many more stepfathers than you already have.
 She knows what she's talking about, Alan.
 Mom's been on more hotel pillows than a chocolate mint.
 Don't help me, Charlie.
 Now Now, listen, sweetheart.
 Sweetheart, no offense but since you're dirt-poor and living with your brother one must ask, what kind of woman would agree to marry you? Unless she's a little slow, or looking for a green card.
 Listen to your mommy, Alan.
 No.
 No, I am gonna listen to my heart.
 For your information, she hasn't agreed to marry me.
 - I haven't even asked her yet.
 - But you're planning to? - Yes.
 - I'm not going to hit you, darling.
 Charlie.
 Okay, look, I will thank you both to let me live my own life.
 I love Nancy, and Nancy loves me.
 And if this is a mistake, then it will be my mistake.
 Hello? Nancy.
 You miss me? I miss you.
 Listen, there's something I wanna ask you, but I wanna do it in person.
 Oh, oh, okay, okay.
 I understand.
 Yeah, sure.
 Sure.
 Bye.
 Her husband came back a day early.
 Okay, my mistake.
 - You hungry? - What do we got? What do you want? I don't know.
 What are my choices? You can cook something, or go live on the street.
 I'm not hungry.
 






                    			I decided if I was gonna get my boobs done I might as well go whole-hog, you know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean.
 They're still pretty natural-Iooking, don't you think? They fooled me.
 Oh, yeah, gotta get right up on them before you can tell.
 I think they're really gonna help me reach my career goals.
 Do you remember what they were? What what were? My career goals.
 Yeah, sure.
 You wanna be an actress, right? No, silly.
 I wanna be a talk show host.
 Right.
 Of course, what they don't tell you is: Big boobies equal bad back.
 Say that three times fast.
 - No, thank you.
 - Big boobies equal bad back.
 Big boobies equal bad back.
 Big boobies equal bad back.
 Get your skinny little butt in here, and I'll interview you standing up.
 I'll be right there.
 Okay, we're back.
 Now, let's give a warm, soapy welcome to my next guest and my close personal friend, Charlie Harper.
 Hey.
 Where you off to? I don't know.
 Anywhere.
 Charlie, the shower's still running.
 Oh, fine.
 There you are.
 Charlie! Charlie, help me! - What's going on? - Nothing.
 Go watch TV.
 Yeah, right.
 Well, I'm sorry, Alan, but who told you to go sticking your hand in my shower? Oh, please.
 How can she sue you? You have no money.
 Oh, boy.
 Nothing.
 Just saw an old girlfriend.
 Talk to you later.
 Lisa? Oh, boy.
 Charlie.
 I don't believe it.
 - You look great.
 - You too.
 Although if you're taking votes, I prefer the brown sock to the beige one.
 What? Oh, I got kind of dressed in a hurry this morning.
 Really? Did somebody's husband come home early? Why do you always assume the worst? Can't I just be hung-over? Sorry.
 So how are you? Fine.
 I mean, you know, considering.
 And you? How's married life? Really great.
 Best decision I ever made.
 You deserve all the happiness in the world and you found a guy who can give it.
 - Thanks.
 That's very sweet.
 - I mean it sincerely.
 It warms my heart - Okay, we broke up.
 Oh, I am so, so sorry.
 Honestly.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 - So, what happened? - None of your business.
 Okay.
 I thought he was the sweetest guy in the world but after we got married, he changed.
 He started drinking a lot, and lying around the house all day.
 Oh, no.
 I caught him in the shower with some bimbo.
 Some guys, huh? Yeah.
 If I wanted that kind of life, I could have stayed with you.
 Good point.
 So, what are you doing for dinner? - You're shameless.
 - Thank you.
 - It's not a compliment.
 - Whatever.
 What are you doing for dinner? Charlie, a lot has changed.
 I know.
 I'm older and wiser, and you're hot and on the rebound.
 - Charlie.
 - Dinner tonight.
 I won't take no for an answer.
 Hey, lady.
 Lady, you forgot your baby.
 Charlie, it's not her baby.
 Shall we say 7? Just out of curiosity, what the hell happened in your brother's bathroom? - Nothing.
 - Dad was wrestling on the floor with a naked lady.
 The quiet ones are always the freaks.
 - Jake, I was not wrestling.
 - But she was naked.
 She was taking a shower, and I didn't know.
 When I reached to turn it off, she was startled.
 It was innocent and there's no reason to tell your mother, understand? Sure.
 By the way, you have to sign my math test.
 Okay.
 D minus? Jake, how do you get a D minus? How do you get wrapped in a shower curtain with a naked lady? - Did you show this to your mother? - No.
 - Why not? - I didn't catch her doing anything.
 Okay, I'll sign this.
 But you are gonna go study so this won't happen again.
 All right, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.
 If you want something from Dad, now's a good time.
 Oh, Alan, I am having the best day.
 - Really? Do share it with me.
 - Remember Lisa? Oh, is that the girl who bitch-slapped me in your shower this morning? No, that's Meegan or Megan or Sue.
 Lisa is the woman that I asked to marry, but she married this other guy instead.
 They're divorced and we're having dinner.
 Isn't that great? I'd applaud, but my hand was bitten earlier.
 I'm sensing you're upset? Oh, no, no, no.
 Why would I be upset? I mean, besides the The bite and the mild concussion that I got from my head bouncing off your bathroom floor while your shower buddy was driving her knee into my groin.
 She wants to be a talk show host.
 I don't see it.
 Not with that voice.
 And to top it all off, my son saw me entwined on the floor with Meegan or Megan or Sue and is now blackmailing me.
 Kid's a genius.
 Anyway, here's the wrinkle with Lisa.
 She's got a kid now.
 I'm not sure where I'm at with having an instant family.
 I'm sorry.
 Are we done with what's bothering me? I am.
 It's like talking to a horny chimp.
 Well, that was uncalled for.
 - So, what do you think? - About what? Lisa, me, the kid.
 Okay, let's see now.
 This is the same woman you've broken up and gotten back with for years, right? - Right.
 And she turned you down in order to marry somebody else? - Yes.
 - And then the marriage fell apart and now she's got his baby? - Yeah.
 Sounds perfect.
 Go for it.
 Okay, don't think I don't know what you're doing.
 Are you gonna be okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
 It's just nobody's taken a crap in my car since college.
 Don't be such a baby.
 Hey, tell her.
 I'll change her diaper while your car airs out.
 Then you can take us home.
 But what if it happens again? Don't worry.
 I'll hold her out the window till we arrive.
 Thank you.
 Can I make you a nightcap? Charlie, I'm breastfeeding, remember? Oh, right, right.
 And may I say, on behalf of myself, the matre d' and the entire kitchen staff that found a reason to walk past our table: You're doing a hell of a job.
 Look at what a good poopie you made.
 Mommy's gonna get you all cleaned up.
 - Would you throw this away? - Sure.
 You didn't throw that on the beach, did you? No, no.
 I threw it on my neighbor's deck.
 Long story.
 He started it.
 - So how we doing? - All done.
 Oh, good.
 Boy, you hear all these horror stories about screaming babies but she's not half bad.
 She's my little angel.
 Kind of weird, huh? You and me and a baby.
 Yeah.
 Not that the baby's weird.
 It's just the whole, you know, gestalt.
 You are so sweet.
 I know.
 Wanna go upstairs? - No, I have to go home.
 - Why? What do you mean, why? I have a baby.
 Okay, she can stay too.
 I can't spend the night.
 I didn't bring enough diapers the bassinet.
 I don't have a breast pump.
 So? We'll do it the old-fashioned way.
 What are you gonna do, Charlie? Milk me? What kind of thing is that to say? What makes you think I'm ready to jump back into bed with you? I don't know.
 Because I'm sweet? You weren't ready when I was single.
 How are you gonna handle me and a baby? Easy.
 I love babies, babies love me.
 Look how good I get along with Jake.
 Jake's 11.
 So? He was 10 when I met him.
 Gosh, they grow so quickly, don't they? - Okay, look.
 If you're serious - I am.
 - Come over tomorrow night to our place.
 I'll make dinner, we'll see what happens.
 Or we go to your place now having already eaten, and see what happens.
 Still incapable of delaying gratification, aren't you? No, no, no, I've grown.
 I learned to put the needs of others before me.
 - Really? - Oh, yeah.
 Absolutely.
 The old thoughtless, selfish Charlie is gone and I say good riddance to him.
 Now, come on.
 I'll take you home.
 - Charlie? - Yeah? The baby.
 This makes no sense.
 It's math.
 It makes perfect sense.
 Well, then I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
 No, you just have to do the work.
 Well, maybe I have a learning disability, or a syndrome of some sort.
 You don't have a learning disability.
 You're just lazy.
 Maybe that's the syndrome.
 See you later.
 And by "later," I'm hoping tomorrow.
 Is there anything in your shower I need to know about? Oh, come on.
 That's the most action you've had in months.
 I have a loose tooth.
 Can't you just be happy for me? The woman I love is back in my life.
 That's great.
 I'm thrilled.
 I can't eat apples.
 I'll bring you back some applesauce from Lisa's.
 Her kid needs to lay off the fiber anyway.
 Oh, yeah.
 How's that working out? With the kid? She's great.
 I love kids.
 Really? Tell me.
 How many diapers have you changed so far? Well, none, actually.
 But I am credited with an assist.
 - Have you fed the baby? - No.
 - Dressed the baby? Bathed the baby? - No.
 What's your point, Alan? - Nothing.
 Have fun.
 - Thanks.
 I intend to.
 Don't think I don't know what you're doing.
 - What was that? - Coyotes, Charlie.
 Probably dropped her pacifier.
 I'll be right back.
 - No, no, no.
 You stay.
 I'll take care of it.
 - Really? Oh, yeah.
 No problem.
 I'm great with babies.
 Pacifier is the little nipple thing, right? Be right back.
 Hey, little baby, you decent? Okay, here's your pacifier, sweetie.
 Not as good as the real thing, am I right? Smells like one of us just crapped our pants.
 I sure hope it's you.
 Let's take a look.
 Charlie? You okay? - What? - Is everything okay? Oh, yeah.
 Just a little diaper issue.
 I can take care of it.
 And then I'll be back to take care of you.
 Okay.
 Let's just take this thing off.
 Oh, sweet Lord.
 Did you have Thai food for dinner, or what? Man, Babe Ruth took smaller dumps.
 Do you need any help? What? Do you need any help? No, we're good.
 Okay.
 Now we wipe the tushy.
 Sorry.
 It's not you.
 It's me.
 Wipe it again.
 Third time's the charm.
 Little powder.
 Oh, that smells nice.
 Maybe a little powder for my tushy.
 Don 't tell your mommy.
 Charlie, I can hear you on the monitor.
 Oh, right.
 People of Earth  we mean you no harm.
 See? This one is wrong, this is wrong.
 Jake, you have to check your work.
 These are careless mistakes.
 Maybe I'm not careless.
 Maybe I ate lead paint as a child.
 - Here.
 Do it again.
 - Fine.
 Dad, are you and Mom related? I'm sorry.
 What? Well, if you marry your cousin, your kids will be stupid, right? Jake, you're not stupid, your mother's not my cousin and you're not going anywhere until you do your homework.
 Like I have somewhere to go.
 There we go.
 You were a hungry little girl.
 Of course she was hungry.
 She must of dropped half her body weight in that last diaper.
 What a good burp.
 Wasn't that a good burp, Charlie? Oh, yeah.
 Wait till you meet my nephew.
 He can belch the theme from Shaft.
 All right.
 Good night, sweetheart.
 Oh, there we go.
 Now, where were we? Oh, yeah.
 You know, I'm a little tired.
 Aren't you tired? - What's wrong? - Nothing.
 Was it the breastfeeding? Because in the restaurant, it turned you on.
 I know, but there I wasn't on deck.
 So you don't wanna fool around? It's not that.
 I'm looking at the sexiest woman in the world and all I can see is a Thermos.
 Charlie, there are things you do with your penis that aren't exactly a turn-on.
 You mean the puppet show? I thought you loved The Amazing Adventures of Stretch Armstrong.
 That's not what I meant.
 Now, come on.
 Come to mama.
 Okay, time.
 "Come to mama" bums me a little.
 Can we make it "Come to Catholic schoolgirl"? Yes, Monsignor.
 Hallelujah.
 Here you go.
 Two sugars, no cream.
 Oh, perfect.
 And I don't mind saying, last night was none too shabby either.
 "Dear diary: Coffee perfect, sex none too shabby.
" You know what I mean.
 I can't remember why we kept breaking up.
 - You can't? - Well, I can.
 I was just being romantic.
 - What are you doing? - Putting on my pants.
 You're leaving already? No.
 So why are you putting on your pants, then? I don't know.
 Did you wanna wear them? Forget it.
 Hey, I've gotta go home sooner or later.
 - Go home whenever you want.
 - I can't leave when you're in this mood.
 - What mood? This mood.
 Oh, just leave, Charlie.
 It's what you do best.
 No, it's what I do after I do what I do best.
 Oh, come on.
 I was just putting on my pants.
 - You wanna spend the day with us? - The whole day? - Here are your shoes.
 - Hang on a second.
 Is this some hormonal thing because of the baby? No, it's some kind of stupid thing because you're stupid.
 Any time I don't behave the way you want, it's hormonal.
 Not every time, but you gotta admit there is a pattern.
 You know the pattern I see? Every time things start going well for us, you find an excuse to run.
 No, no, no.
 You push me away.
 How? How do I push you away? Like this.
 You pick a fight over nothing and say I can't commit.
 - You can't commit.
 - Hey, I can commit.
 Oh, yeah? Prove it.
 Fine.
 I'll start right now.
 I'm gonna stay here all day.
 - Really? - Really.
 We're talking a business day, right? - Hey.
 How did it go with Lisa? - I don't think it's gonna work out.
 Really? Even with the little baby there to help smooth things along? It wasn't the baby.
 She has commitment issues.
 Oh, that's too bad.
 Hey, what's that splattered all over your shirt? Coffee and breast milk.
 What happened? Did Starbucks merge with Hooters? Hooterbucks.
 I'd like a double-D cup latte, please.
 Dad, you gotta sign this.
 Another D? Jake, what is wrong with you? Well, I have a theory.
 Oh, really? Another one.
 Do tell.
 I'm a crack baby.
 Kid's a genius.
 






                    			- What you doing? - I'm working. You're not gonna get much done with the TV on. - What are you, my mother? - Your mother says that too? Listen, when you write music for a living you have to wait for inspiration. Nope, not yet. Charlie, wanna come to the movies with us? He can't. He's working. - On what, liver failure? - Wonderful. He's my mother, you're my doctor. Oh, I assume you finished reading Lord of the Flies for your book report. Oh, good. How'd you like it? I thought it was a timeless American classic. I see. So tell me, what's it about? - You mean the book? - Yeah, the book. It's called Lord of the Flies and it's about a really big fly that all the other flies pray to. - And you thought he didn't read it. - Oh, I was just joking. It's more like Charlotte's Web, but from the fly's point of view. You've had more than a week. Why didn't you read the book? - I've been waiting for inspiration. - Attaboy. Okay, how's this for inspiration? We're not going to the movies and you're not doing anything until you finish reading that book. - That's not fair. - Course it's fair. We had a deal. - You didn't keep your end of it. - Oh, so now two wrongs make a right? Bet you didn't see that one coming. You're really gonna like this book if you give it a chance. It's about kids stranded on a deserted island. - How'd they get stranded? - Their plane crashes. Oh, really. And then what happens? This one kid named Ralph becomes their leader, and they form this society, and Just read the book. - One big fly, huh? - Hey, I took a shot. Hi. - Charlie's working, Rose. - Oh, what about Jake? He's studying. - Hey, do you like smoked salmon? - I guess. Good. Then this is for you. - I don't know what to say. - Neither do I, most of the time. But then I start talking, and stuff just comes out. So, what are you doing this fine Saturday night? I was supposed go to the movies with Jake but he didn't do his homework, so So you're punishing him by sitting out here all by yourself, alone and miserable. What a good dad. If you still wanna go to the movies, I'll go with you. - You and me? Like a? Like a date? - Alan, are you asking me out? - I don't think so. - Okay. That was a little awkward. Come on, we'll catch an early show. Oh, all right. All right, why not. I'll sneak in the salmon under my sweater. Good. That way, we don't have to pay for that overpriced movie fish. - Hey. What you doing? - Working. How do you know when you're on a break? That's the thing about being a grownup, my little friend: You don't get breaks. Is this the new Oshikuru: Demon Samura? - Yeah. - What are you doing with it? It's being turned into a cartoon, and they asked me to write the theme song. - Awesome. - Yeah? - Wanna hear what I got so far? - Sure. So I'll be, like, the first kid in the world to hear this. Yep. Now, this is just a rough version, but you get an idea of the feel of it. Okay. Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru Oh, oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru My, oh, my He's a demon samurai Who 's the guy who had to die? Oshikuru Boy. That really blows. Excuse me? - Did you even read the comic? - Yeah, I looked it over. Oh, really? What's it about? It's about this guy named Oshikuru, who dies and comes back as a, what do you call it, samurai. - And he's a demon. - No. It's about a teenage boy in a futuristic society who's possessed by the tortured soul of a feudal Japanese warrior condemned to walk the earth fighting the evil he once embodied. So, what's your point? He lives in a dark world. He battles the spirits of the damned. Your theme doesn't capture the mood at all. It just blows. - Okay, okay, you said "blows" already. - Did I say "big baby chunks"? All right, fine. Thanks for your input. Why don't you go read Lord of the Flies, and let me do my job. Well, if your job is ruining a great comic book, you can call it a night. - I heard that. - Good. Oh, no. What do you wanna bet Shrek here sits right in front of us. Don't worry. It'll be all right. You had to eat the chili cheeseburger. - That wasn't really necessary. - You'd have done the same thing for me. I'm not so sure. - So, Alan, tell me about yourself. - What would you like to know? Everything. I really don't know that much about you aside from the fact that you're Charlie's brother and Jake's dad. Graduated from Cal State Long Beach, married your college sweetheart and in the middle of the night, when you're half-asleep, you pee sitting down. - Have you been spying on me? - No, silly. I spy on Charlie. You just get in the way sometimes. You know what? Why don't you tell me about you. Well, okay. Well, let's see. I, too, pee sitting down, so we have that in common. I come from a wealthy family, so I guess I've had kind of a sheltered life. You know, fancy private schools and colleges. - No kidding. - What college did you go to? Princeton. But just for two years. - Oh, so you dropped out? - No, I finished. Then I came back to California to do my master's at Stanford. That's amazing. What's your degree in? Behavioral psychology. Hey, Jake. Jake, wake up. I want you to hear something. - What? - I've been working on the song. - Good for you. - Come on. Come listen to it. - I'm sleeping. - Sleep in school, like everybody else. I read the comic books cover to cover. I know the characters, I know their world. I think I got it. Listen. A teenage boy with the spirit inside Of a samurai warrior who long ago died Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru My, oh, my He's a demon samurai Who 's the guy who had to die? Oshikuru Still blows. Yeah, well, you're still short. - Hey. - Hey. Sorry I'm late. We stopped for a bite to eat after the movie. - No problem. - An usher confiscated our fish. - Hey, can I play you something? - Sure. You know, I had a really good time with Rose. There's a lot more there than meets the eye. Yeah. Cool. Listen to this. Tell me what you think. A teenage boy with the spirit inside Of a samurai warrior who long ago died Now he's oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru My, oh, my He's a demon samurai Who 's the guy who had to die? Oshikuru Very nice. It's snappy. - You really like it? - Yeah, yeah. Good work. Okay, that settles it. It blows. Berta, you know what's a good book? Lord of the Flies. Oh, yeah. I read that when I was about your age. - So, what'd you think? - I liked it. - It was like Survivor with kids. - Yeah. I agree. - Is Survivor spelled like it sounds? - Just read the damn book. - Morning, Berta. - Morning. Hey, did you know that Rose has a master's degree in psychology? No. Did you know I'm a founding member of the Mile High Club? - Really? - Yeah. Me and Orville at Kitty Hawk. I'd have done Wilbur too, but we were only in the air for 90 seconds. Okay, you're kidding, and it's funny. But the truth is, you and I see each other every day and we don't know much about each other. So you wanna know what goes on underneath this gruff exterior. Whether somewhere inside me, there's a tiny little girl who once dreamed of being a famous ballerina. - Is there? - Lf there is it's because I accidentally ate one and haven't passed her yet. Let me tell you, I am dreading that tiara. - Okay. Well, it was nice talking to you. - Hey, I feel closer. Oh, are you starting that book report already? - Just making notes. - Good for you. What do you have so far? Lord of the Flies is kind of like Survivor, but with kids. That's an interesting analogy. What's your favorite part? When the first kid gets voted off the island? Hey, all right. Stop trying to be friends with Berta. It just pisses her off. What doesn't? Hey, I was gonna do some shopping, and was hoping you could watch Jake. - Sure. - Ready when you are, Alan. - Be right there. I'll see you later. - No, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. - You're going out with Rose again? - No, I'm not "going out" with her. - We're just going shopping. - Morning, Charlie. You haven't forgotten that she's a little bent, right? No, I think there's a lot more to her than that. - Deep down, there's a good person. - Deep down, there's a few good people. And all of them are bent. - He'll be right with you, Rose. - Okay. - Charlie, everybody has flaws. - Flaws? She Superglued my testicles to my thigh. That was the past. We've all done things we're ashamed of. She's not ashamed. She took a picture, then used it for her Christmas card. Thank God it was an extreme close-up. Most people thought it was a fruit bat. Okay, well, I appreciate your concern but I think Rose is a sweet, smart, interesting woman. I enjoy spending time with her. Meet me out front. Okey-dokey. - Hey, what're you doing? - Reading Lord of the Flies. Not important. - Now, listen. You're a kid, right? - Yeah. Okay. I'm writing a song for kids. So assuming that what I've done already blows - It does. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Assuming that, you need to help me make it better. - But I have to do a book report. - Okay. I'll help you with the book report. You help me with the song. - Quid pro quo. - No. "Oshikuru." Here you go. Raspberry-mango-banana with a shot of wheatgrass. - Thank you. - My pleasure. You know, sometimes I like to come to the mall and just watch people and make up stories about who they are and what their lives are like. - Oh, well, that's fun. What about that lady over there? What do you think her life is like? Well, I'd say she's a smart woman, but very Ionely. So used to rejection, it's become like the air she breathes which is all the more sad because she's got so much to give. Emotionally, spiritually, sexually. Especially sexually. She is ripe, smoldering and willing to try anything. - What about that lady over there? - Her? Well, let's see. She's a little tougher to read. I'd say she's a smart woman, very Ionely. So used to rejection, it's become like the air she breathes which is all the more sad See, even though Oshikuru is for kids, it's not really a kids' comic. - It's very mature. - Okay, I think I got it. The demons Oshikuru fights only exist because they are a reflection of the tortured demons in his own soul. - Yes. - So, in essence Oshikuru is like a Japanese sci-fi version of Moby Dick. - What? - You said, "Moby Dick." I mean, sure, being single can be Ionely sometimes but it's better than being together with someone you don't love or respect. - Is that what your marriage was like? - Well, according to my ex-wife, it was. Hey, as long as we're done here why don't we take a drive down to the beach and take a walk. - Alan, are you flirting with me? - Oh, no, no. I just thought, you know, since it's a beautiful day If you are, it's okay. - Really? - Yeah. There's a lot more to you than I thought. - What did you think? - Oh, let's not spoil the moment. Okay. So, what do we do now? - Wanna try kissing? - Yes, I think we should. - Okay. - Yeah. - Wanna get a room? - Excuse me? Or we can go back to my place, unless you're afraid of ferrets. - Ferrets? - Yeah. I have five of the toothy little guys. No kidding. Five ferrets. - Those are like long, furry rats, right? - Yep. And they're all named Charlie. Of course they are. Well, as much as I would love to meet Charlie and Charlie and Charlie and Charlie - And Charlie. - Right. I can't help but wonder, is it worth putting our friendship at risk? Well, that's a good question. Let's think about it for a minute. How good are you in bed? Because I'm excellent. Truthfully, I'm more of an advanced intermediate. - Then let's stay friends. - Yeah, good idea. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. What, specifically, turned you off to the idea of a physical liaison? Was it the psychosexual fraternal rivalry, symbolized by the Charlie surrogates? Or the prospect of being judged inadequate by a woman who professes to have superior sexual skills? Wait a minute. Have you been doing that behavioral psychology thing on me? No, don't be silly. But if I said yes, would that make you feel A, angry, or B, insecure? I thought you were gonna write the report for me. No, Jake. That would be wrong. The only way to learn is to do the work yourself. Now, these are called Cliff Notes. Inside is everything you need to know about Lord of the Flies. The themes, the characters, the symbolism. It's a book report waiting for you to put your name on it. Is that legal? Look around. Do you see any homework police? Oh, man. I give you way too much credit. Oh, I meant to ask you, how'd that book report turn out? - I got a D-minus. - D-minus? - Didn't you read the Cliff Notes? - That was 50 pages. Unbelievable. Your kid's too lazy to cheat. Has it occurred to you that maybe he's too honest to cheat? No, I'm lazy. - Oshikuru: Demon Samurai. - Hey, it's on. Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru Oh, oh, oh, Oshikuru My, oh, my He's a demon samurai Who 's the guy who had to die? Oshikuru That's not what we wrote. That's your original, sucky version. What can I tell you? The network liked that one better. - What, are they brain-damaged? - Welcome to show business, kid. I still think it's snappy. Oshikuru   





                    			Two white wines and a Jack and ginger. Please tell me the Jack and ginger isn't for you. No, it's for my girlfriend. Why? You look like a woman of discriminating taste and mixing a quality bourbon with ginger ale is like putting Cheez Whiz on lobster Newburgh. Well, what if I said the Jack and ginger was for me? Well, then, I'd learn to live with it. - Charlie. - Gail. Sorry I'm late. I stopped off at Radio Barn, and wait till you see what I got. Alan, I'm kind of in the middle of Damn you to hell. - What? What did I do? - Forget it. It's who you are, you can't help yourself. Okay. Anyway, check this out. Know what that is? - A two megapixel, full-color webcam. - Right. How do I do it? I got one for me and for Jake. We can hook them to our computers so when he's at his mother's, we can have video chats. - That's cool. - Isn't it? Yeah, with a couple of these, phone sex becomes less phone and more sex. These are to maintain my relationship with Jake. It's the worst part of the divorce: - Only seeing him on weekends. - I get that. I sympathize. But you can see the validity of my vision too, right? Oh, look. Built-in microphone. Totally hands-free. Perfect. - Excuse me. - Oh, hey, Gail. Good to see you again. Don't move, don't talk. - Are you Charlie Harper? - Yeah. Why? You were right. It's him. What? What? What's funny? Nothing. So listen, can I buy you a drink? He wants to buy me a drink. Then what? We go back to your beach house sit on the deck, look at the stars, talk about how you love being an uncle and how you'd like kids of your own and by the way, I have the most beautiful eyes in the world. I'm sorry. Have we met before? No. And we're not gonna meet now. Okay. I have a bad feeling. Is the camera on? Good. Now, hit "connect." I can see you. Can you see me? Yeah, yeah. I can hear you too. You can hang up the phone. This is awesome. - Yeah, we can see each other every day. - Cool. So What's new? Nothing. What's new with you? Not much. - Hey, Charlie. - Rose, stop. - What? - We're friends now, right? Right. Our one-night stand is ancient history. You're not stalking me anymore, right? - Right. - Then use the damn stairs. - Really? - Yes. Okay. - I'm opening up the gate. - I'm proud of you. - I'm starting up the stairs. - You can do it. Oh, boy. I don't know about this. - You'll get used to it. - Yeah, we'll see. I'm surprised to see you home. - It's ladies' night at Pavlov's. - I know. Well, isn't that kind of like rabbit season for Elmer Fudd? Used to be. Let me ask you question. How much do chicks talk about men they've been with? Not as much as you'd think. - Really? - Way more. - Why? - Well, I ran into some women last night. Never met them before. But they seem to have already formed a poor opinion of me. So you think somebody's out there spreading nasty rumors? Worse. I think somebody's out there spreading the truth. Well, you have burned a few bridges in this town. Hey, I don't burn bridges. I have casual sex with relative strangers. There's a difference. And I'm always honest. I never lead a woman on. Unless I'm, you know, totally bombed. Last night was probably the result of one woman with an ax to grind. Probably. Yeah, that's it. - I'm making myself crazy over nothing. - Oh, I do that all the time. It's a great way to fill up a slow weekend. Rose, that night we spent together did I tell you you had beautiful eyes? Well, let's see. We had a couple of drinks, you invited me back here. We were sitting out on the deck, looking at the stars. And, yeah, you said: "By the way, you have the most beautiful eyes in the world." I guess I do use that a lot. But, damn it, it's good. Are you sure it's not red? Look again. It looks fine. You have to go to school tomorrow. - Good night, Rose. - Night, Charlie. And don't forget to use the Never mind. Oh, Charlie, Charlie. Come here. - Say hello to your Uncle Charlie. - Hey, Uncle Charlie. - Hi, Jake. - I can see you. I can see you too. So What's new? Not much. What's new with you? Nothing. Oh, wait. I Googled you  and you'll never guess what I found. Jake, are you in the bathtub? Yeah. Gotta go. No, no, no. Wait, Jake, what are you talking about? - What's he talking about? - I don't know. But if you Google me, you'll find pages that mention my San Fernando Valley Chiropractor of the Year award. That's nice. Get out of the way. Oh, careful. There's another Alan J. Harper. He's a school bus driver, and he also makes these decorative pigs out of bleach bottles and pipe cleaners. I'm not Googling you. I'm Googling me. "CharlieHarperSucks. Com." That's gotta be a different Charlie Harper. Okay. I have a bad feeling. Oh, boy. Oh, man. Oh, crap. - Are you still reading that thing? - How can I not? It's an entire website devoted to trashing me. Listen to this: "Has anybody had sex with Charlie where he actually took his socks off?" That's just mean. I have bad circulation in my feet. They get cold. Check this out. Some girl posted audio off her answering machine. Hey, it's me. I just wanted to tell you I had a great time last night. - And I'm looking forward - Hello, Charlie? Yeah, hi. We weren 't together last night. Allison? No, Beth. Thursday. I had a great time with you Thursday, and I thought that may Oh, Alan, what am I gonna do? Every woman in the city can see this stuff. Every woman in the world. Oh, God. Well, you know what they say. Any publicity is Good publicity. No, no, no. What I do requires secrecy. I need shadows and darkness. I'm like a magician. If everybody knows how I do it, it ceases to be entertaining. "Frequently Asked Questions." - Don't read that. - Yeah, right. Okay. Question: "How long can you expect to date Charlie after you have sex with him?" Answer: " It depends how late you sleep the next morning." Oh, come on. This is funny. You're just too close to it. This could be interesting. Question: "How does Charlie manage to fake my orgasm?" All right, stop it. Move over. - What are you doing? - I've gotta fight back. Anybody can post on the message board. Why not me? - You're gonna post as yourself? - Don't be ridiculous. Everybody uses a screen name. "CharlieFreak219." Too many? Okay. CharlieFreak180. "In my experience Charlie has always been a generous lover compassionate, fun-Ioving and sensitive." There. That ought to bring a little balance to the conversation. You really don't get the Internet, do you? Oh, look. I've got a response already. "Dear Freak: Are you just stupid or did your skull bounce off his headboard too many times?" Okay, I've had enough of this. - How do I delete this whole thing? - You can't delete a website. Only the person who created it can. - Well, how do I find out who created it? - Now, let's see. Come on. Okay. Okay, the domain is the property of a company in the Cayman Islands called: "Charlie Harper Sucks Limited." Well, that's no help. Hey, you can buy T-shirts and coffee mugs. "Add to cart." No, Mom, it is not that simple. I am a single mother now. Dating is very complicated. I understand. No, I can 't go back to Alan. Of course I still love him. Hey, Alan? How long you think this Internet fad is gonna last? - Okay. - What? Jake must've turned on his webcam before he went to school. I can see and hear Judith talking to her mother on the phone. - Why can't she hear us? - Our side's turned off. Are you kidding? Alan would never take me back. How do I know? I just know. Okay, fine. I'll ask him. - She wants me back. - Yes, I will ask him. That's nice. It's all about you. Okay. Listen, Mom, I gotta get in the shower. I got it. Yes. All right. I'll call you later. Oh, man. - Charlie, I need to talk about this. - Me too. If I don't do something about that website I'm gonna have to chase Amish broads. Judith wants to reconcile. I've dreamed about this but now that it's here, I wonder if it's what I want. Whoever put up that site has to be somebody I went out with at least once. It would be great for Jake to have both parents in one house. And without alimony, I could stop getting my hair cut at the barber college. I can eliminate married chicks, ones that don't speak English and those to whom I was never properly introduced. I'll make a list of the pros and cons of going back to her. You know what? I'm gonna need to make a list. - I'm glad we talked. - I'm always here for you. Me too. Hi, Tina. Long time, huh? Charlie Harper. What do you want? I know things didn't end well between us, and Really? I thought they ended perfectly. We spent a week in Cancn, having great sex every day. Flew back to L.A. You told me you'd call me tomorrow, and it's been What do you know? A year and a half. - That long? - Oh, yeah. I guess time flies when you're the scum of the earth. Okay, I had that coming. I was thoughtless and insensitive, and I know I can never really make up for it but I want you to know that I was wrong, and I'm really, truly sorry. - And? - No "and." I just wanted to apologize for being a jerk. I wanna make amends. - You really mean that, don't you? - I do. Absolutely. - You wanna come in for a cup of coffee? - Sure, I guess. So, seeing anybody? "Pro: No alimony. Con: No sex." "Pro: See Jake all the time. Con: See Judith all the time." What are you doing? Give me that. - I'm sorry. It was just laying there. - That's private. Okay. I got another "pro" for you. - Yeah? What's that? - Lf you hook back up with Olive Oyl I won't have to scrub your toilet anymore. Pro: No more Berta. You're not really thinking about going back, are you? I don't know. She wants to, but I'm torn. You're not torn. You're gutless. - Do you still love her? - Of course I do. I mean, you know, we've been though a lot of things together. - She's the mother of my son. - Okay, listen to me, Zippy. If that's all it took to make a marriage I'd have a husband for each of my tattoos. - You have tattoos? - Yeah. You wanna see them? No. You're overthinking this. When your dog dies, you don't make a list. You bury him, plant a shrub on top tell the kids he's running around a farm, and move on. That's actually a very apt metaphor. My failed marriage is like a dead dog. But it serves as fertilizer for the shrub, which represents my new life. So if I try to revitalize the marriage You know, digging up the dog. - Then I'm killing the shrub, which is me. Like you said, it's apt. Thank you, Berta. You're a very insightful woman. I know. In a just world, you'd be washing my shorts. Well, thanks, nevertheless. Last chance to see those tattoos. No thanks. I can make the Road Runner do jumping jacks. That was a fun apology. Yeah, I really thought I was the one who deserved a spanking. - So you'll call me? - Count on it. Hey, not that I really care, but, do you happen to know who started that silly website? No. I just found it by Googling your name. Most women Google the guys they go out with, you know. Yeah, I've heard. - Well, I'll see you soon. - You better. Okay. That went well. Let's see. Who's next? Jake, why don't you go watch some TV. I need to talk to your dad. Is this about the firecrackers? What firecrackers? I'll go watch TV. Come in, sit down. Thanks. Listen - Boy, this is tough. - Okay, okay, maybe I can make it easier for you. Judith I will always love you but there's no going back for me. I've learned a lot about myself in the last year, and I'm growing. And And I wanna keep on growing. I will always cherish what we had but I have to fertilize my shrub. - What are you talking about? - It's Berta's metaphor. The The bottom line is: I don't want to reconcile. Our marriage is over. Well, what makes you think I wanna reconcile? What did you wanna talk to me about? My mom wanted me to ask if Jake could spend a couple of weeks with them this summer. - Oh, really? - That's what she wanted you to ask me? - Yes. You didn't tell her you loved me, you missed me? Well, I always tell her that to shut her up. And how the hell do you know what I talk to my mother about? Hey, look, Charlie's here. - Answer my question, Alan. - Hold on a second, Judith. - Charlie, what's wrong? - I've been making amends. Five amends in one afternoon. Well, technically, four. I had to fake the last one. - Charlie, Alan and I are talking. - Don't worry. I'll be out of your way as soon as I check on something. They all denied running the website but at least I should have some good reviews now. Listen to this: "Charlie came over and apologized today, and, oh, what an apology it was. I take back everything nasty I ever said about him." Not bad, huh? Here's another one: "He apologized to you today? He apologized to me too." Okay, I have a bad feeling again. Alan, how do you know what I said to my mother? I didn't actually know. I surmised. I should go talk to Charlie. Hey, Dad, check it out. I can see my room on your computer. Okay, now I've got a bad feeling. My heart was in the right place, Rose. - I know. - All I wanted to do was apologize. - I had no ulterior motives. - I believe you. Thank you. Did I ever apologize to you? You mean, for our one-night stand that kind of, sort of broke my heart? Yeah, for that. No, not really. Okay, well, I am truly sorry. You're a wonderful person, and you deserved better. Thank you, Charlie. - That's sweet. - I mean it. - What's that? - Oh, this? It's one of those new web browser, e-mail gadgets. Cool. 





                    			- What's that? - My high school yearbook. Hey, do you remember a girl named Jamie Eckelberry? - No. - Yeah, sure you do. She used to hang out at the house all the time. Oh, yeah. Eckelberry Hound. Not a name she was fond of. Hey, I didn't make it up. I just spread it around. What about her? Oh, she called the alumni association and tracked me down. How does that work? They let her sniff one of your sweaters? She e-mailed me. She's in town on business, and I invited her over. Great. I'll get out of your way. Just keep her off the good rug. Very funny. No. For your information, it's not a date. She's just a friend who has become very successful in her field. Oh, that's nice that she has a field to run around in. - It's getting old, Charlie. - In people years or dog years? Sorry. Oh, look. You remember Miss Hanrahan? - Sure. I had her for sophomore English. - I had her in the teachers' lounge. Oh, that's Jamie. Be nice. I'm always nice. Ask Miss Hanrahan. - I'm serious. - Relax. I'm just gonna say hello scratch her behind the ear, and then I'm out of here. - You done with the dog jokes? - Yes. - Good. - I hope she looks fetching. Okay, I guess I had one more. - Alan. - Jamie. Do you remember how Stuart Negelman used to tell everybody you were gay? Don't remind me. I had one Boy George album and suddenly I'm queen of the fairies. You'll be happy to know I ran into him in New York. - And? Knew it. - Gay. Okay, here we go. Two margaritas, and a rum and Diet Coke. - Thank you, Charlie. - You're welcome. - Cheers. - Cheers. So Stuart Negelman: Buttoned-down, or singing show tunes on a float? Very macho. Owns a gym in SoHo. Speaking of which, you look like you're in good shape. - I have kept up with the hacky sack. - Good for you. And you. I cannot get over what a beautiful woman you've become. - Oh, stop it. You're embarrassing me. - Too bad. It's true. Charlie, that's lovely. You still play. Just professionally. - You became a musician? - More a composer. Gotta pay the bills. Play the jingle you wrote for the feminine deodorant commercial. Okay. Fresh as a summer breeze Clean as a mountain spring No. You wrote that? I love that. Hey, hey, did I tell you that I was voted Chiropractor of the Year by the San Fernando Valley Chiropractic Association? Oh, that's fantastic, Alan. You must be very proud. Well, it's not pride so much as the satisfaction I get from helping people. Carefree, so carefree What every woman wants to be Hey. Hey, you know what would be fun? A session of Dungeons & Dragons. Like the old days, you know? - Just the two of us. - Wow, I haven't played in years. Or we can go down to the beach and go for a swim. - I didn't bring a suit. - So my plan is working. You know, I think I'll take a rain check. Do you mind if I use your restroom? Down the hall on the right. Thank you. Don't you have enough women? No. Anyway, you said she was just an old friend. Well, that was before I saw her. Come on, I spent years laying the groundwork for this. And yet you never erected anything on the site. Because she didn't look like that then. Oh, shame on you, Alan Harper. Don't you know a woman is so much more than what's on the outside? She's a mountain spring, a summer breeze and I saw her first. What are you, 11? Come on. She's smart, she's beautiful, she's the kind of woman who - You could never get? - Exactly. Well, if she's that important to you. She is, she is. Very much. - Okay, fine. I'm out of it. - Really? Happy birthday. Isn't that presumptuous? You think you can just give this woman as a gift? - Okay, forget it. - No, no. Happy birthday to me. Listen, I have an early meeting in the morning, so I should probably get going. Oh, no, no. The night is so young, and Charlie was just leaving. Yeah, if I don't start drinking now, I'll be up all night. I really have to get going. What about dinner tomorrow night? - That would be great. - Okay, terrific. Why don't the three of us meet at 7? The The three of us? Oh, gee. Tomorrow night? I can't. Oh, come on, Charlie. I'm only in town for a few days. It wouldn't be the same without you. Right, Alan? That's That's true. It would be different. But still good. No, no, no. You guys have a lot of catching up to do. I insist. Charlie, you have to come. Well, if it's okay with Alan Of course. Okay, great. Then I will see you both tomorrow. - Okay. - Thank you. - Can't wait. - I know. Me too. Good night. Bye. So I'll get you something else for your birthday. You like hookers? Charlie, we agreed you're out. Now stay out. - All right, fine. I won't go. - Thank you. Wait! If you don't come, she'll think I told you not to come. There is that possibility. That's your plan. To make me look petty and insecure. Alan, I don't have to plan for that. Let me tell you something. You're coming with us, whether you like it or not. All right. Wait! - We should take your new Mercedes. - Fine. - I should drive it so she thinks it's mine. - Okay. Wait! She'll never believe I drive a Mercedes. You'll drive my old Volvo so that she thinks it's yours. Whatever. That just means you'll be sitting in the backseat alone. Wait! Charlie, I can't believe that after all these years, you're still single. Well It's not that hard to believe. I'm a selfish, promiscuous, commitment-phobic man. Alan, on the other hand, is a very generous, loyal, one-woman kind of guy. Guilty. Why doesn't that surprise me? Now, what is surprising is to hear a man be so honest and forthcoming about his flaws. Charlie, you are a real breath of fresh air. Guilty. But if you really want a breath of fresh air, take a lungful of Alan. He is a true gentleman. Oh, Alan's always been a gentleman. I remember one time we were kids. We were in my bedroom playing Stratego and my blouse came unbuttoned, and Alan, instead of sneaking a peek like a lot of guys would do, averted his eyes and said, "Jamie, bosom." Really. Is that true, Alan? Pretty much. We were playing Boggle, not Stratego. Well, there you go. A gentleman. A better man than I. Oh, don't put yourself down, Charlie. You seem like a wonderful man to me. Yeah, but you heard him. I'm better. Excuse me. I'll be right back. I think he wants to talk. You know, you are such a good brother. You have no idea. "Bosom"? Forget that. What the hell are you doing? What? I'm trying to make you look good. Turns out it's not that easy. You look like you're trying to make me look good but you're making you look good. I don't know how, but that's the net result. - Alan, you're being ridiculous. - Am I? I think not. From the minute we walked in, you've been sabotaging me. - How? - How? Look at where I'm sitting. - What? You wanted to sit next to her. - Yeah, and you let me. And now you get to stare into her eyes, and I get to stare into her ear. What do you want from me? Wanna change seats? Sure. That won't look suspicious. I'm just trying to help, Alan. Well, how about that? I do have to pee. You wanna help me? Stop talking me up. - It's killing me. - Okay. Stop putting yourself down. That's killing me too. - Got it. - Just sit there and eat your dinner and I'll play your game. Fine. You wanna shake on it? You're disgusting. Yeah, I'm disgusting. At least I'm not the one taking a squirt on my shoe. Let me tell you something about my brother. He puts himself down, but he is truly a wonderful man. I mean, here's a guy, single, good-Iooking, talented - Well, l - You're too modest. Talented, a ton of money. And what does he do when his brother and nephew need a place to live? Does he complain about us cramping his style? No. He opens up his home, and his heart. And frankly, I don't know which one is bigger. You are an incredible human being. Can we get the damn check, please? Wait till you meet Jake. He's a great kid. You're gonna love him. Right, Charlie? Don't oversell him, Alan. He mostly sits around and eats. What do you guys like to do together? Oh, we do all kinds of father-son things. - We go to the movies - Where he sits and eats. And we also build models You know, airplanes, and fly them off the deck. - That sounds like fun. - Oh, it is. Jake loves it. I mean, he is a great kid. I can't wait to meet him. How about tomorrow afternoon? - Tomorrow sounds great. - Good, good. It's a date. - So don't be late. - Or we'll have to wait. Oh, okay. Here we are. Thank you so much. I had a wonderful time. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Good night. Good night, Charlie. Good night. To the Batcave, Alfred. Go to hell. I was just sitting here. I didn't put her tongue in my mouth. You got tongue? Actually, looking back, it was probably mine. Oh, relax. I'm just screwing with you. Besides, you're the one who got the date. You had to pimp your kid out to do it, but you got there. Hey, hey, there is nothing wrong with bragging on my son. He's a reflection of me, and if that compensates for some of my social clumsiness And maybe rustles up a little tail. I am not pimping him out. Don't bark at me. I'm proud of you. Thank you. And make yourself scarce tomorrow. - I don't need any more of your help. - Fine. You're on your own. Now, hush up and drive Miss Daisy home. Okay, Sky Captain. Ready to go? I guess. See how he loves this? Pilot to copilot. Contact. What? - Contact. - Why are you talking like that? Just Just start the engine. Here we go. Ready for liftoff? It's not a rocket ship, Dad. I know that, Jake. Hey, it actually works. Bring it up. Bring it up. - Okay. - Come on, Jake, up, up. It's - Don't yell. - Give me that. - No, I'm doing it. - Well, then do it. I am. Is that it? No, go get it, and we'll patch her back up, like we always do. Can we just order a pizza and watch TV? Go get the plane. This sucks. "This sucks." Isn't he a hoot? He's great. So here we are. Yep. I just cannot get over how much you've changed. - You like? - Yeah, me like. I mean I mean, I like. So where's Charlie? This is all I could find. - Guess who that is. - No way. - Way. - What was going on with your hair? It's called a Jeri curl. It was my Michael Jackson period. Who's the tall guy next to you? Oh, that's me, Jake. Oh, sorry. Well, at least you look like a girl now. Thank you. Was Dad your boyfriend? Oh, no, no. Jamie and I were just friends. Yeah, we were never that way. Are you that way now? - Why don't you go watch TV? - Finally. You know, Jamie, I've been thinking. You're single. I'm single. Well, we have an awful lot in common. I mean, there's no reason we couldn't try to be you know, more than friends. Is that something you'd want? Well - Hey. - Oh, darn. - Sorry to intrude. - That's okay. It's good to see you. I thought you were gonna be busy. I was. I went to a movie, shot some pool bought a book, bought a shirt, drank a bucket of coffee, read the book. And then it occurred to me: "Hey, I have a home." Hey, Dad, can you microwave some popcorn for me? - Why can't you make it for yourself? - Remember what happened last time? You're old enough to make popcorn without starting a fire. Okay, I'll give it a shot. I'll be right back. So Jake's a great kid, isn't he? Yeah, I suppose. I would never say this to Alan, but I don't really care much for children. Well, the truth is, Alan's not too fond of him either. He feeds the kid and keeps a roof over his head but there's no love lost between them. - Charlie, give it a rest. - Sorry? Why do you push me towards Alan when it's obvious how much you want me? He's got a birthday coming up. Just tell me you want me. Go ahead, Charlie. Tell her. What? No, no. You two, with the Dungeons, the Dragons, the Boggle. You should be together. Clearly she wants you, so let's be grown-up, and I'll get out of the way so the two pretty people can mate. No, no, no, no. You laid the foundation and you should, you know, lay the rest of it. I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I am stepping aside - No, no. I'm stepping aside. - No, no. I am. No, no, I'll step aside. I will clear the way. Will you both just shut up? You're ruining everything. - Nice going. - Nice going. - Say it, Charlie. - Say what? Say that slick, cool, Charlie Harper finally wants Eckelberry Hound. - You knew about that name? - That name scarred me for life. It's the reason I haven't eaten a carbohydrate since college. - Well, you do look good. - You're damn right I look good you smug, shallow son of a bitch. I have spent years working and sweating and dreaming about the day that I would be able to rub your smarmy nose in it. Okay, I'm getting mixed signals here. This is the signal, Charlie: You can't have this. Not now, not ever. Never, never, never! You know, I didn't make up the Eckelberry Hound thing. But he did spread it around. I was always your friend. Oh, please. I spent years throwing myself at you, friend. Playing stupid nerd games on my bed with my shirt open, buddy. Hoping that you would kiss me or touch me or at least notice me as a woman, pal! - You knew your shirt was open? - Who do you think opened it? But I wasn't pretty enough for you. You wanted Donna DeMarco or Maxine Chernikoff, just because they had big boobs and no excess facial hair. Oh, yeah. Donna DeMarco, old Double D. Jamie, I had no idea. I am so sorry. But I was a stupid teenager. I guess I just didn't appreciate you then. I guess not. But that was a long time ago. I'm not a stupid teenager anymore. Do you think maybe you could forgive me, and maybe we could try again? Is that what you really want, Alan? Very much. Well, eat your heart out. You can never have this. Never, never, never! Well, I guess we know why she's still single. You're right, Dad. This is fun. Told you. It just takes a little while to get the hang of it. See if I can bring it in for a landing. Probably not a good idea. There's no real place to put it. What do you think Donna DeMarco's doing these days?   





                    			Crap. Oopsie. Oh, Charlie! Okay, I guess I'll give you a call. Alrighty, that'd be great. Sounds good. Looking forward to it. Bye-bye now. Swell. Hey, Alan. You know how to say: "Please go faster," in Polish? - Funny language, isn't it? - Yeah, hilarious. The earthquake hit Sherman Oaks a lot harder than Malibu. - What earthquake? - What earthquake? About an hour ago. You didn't feel the house shaking? Unbelievable. You actually thought that was you? No, I thought it was her, you know, because of me. The good news is, unless they report it on Polish TV I still get the credit. I'm thrilled for you. Anyway, Judith called. A pipe broke, soaked her living room carpet and she's completely freaking out. Yeah, well, that's the difference between wife and ex-wife. With ex-wife, you don't even have to pretend to care. Well, I'm sorry. I can't be that callous. Have you even tried? She's the mother of my son. I'm concerned about her welfare. I told her she could stay here until repairs. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back up. Back up. When you told her, did you have, like, a sarcastic chuckle in your voice? Like, you know, " Yeah, right, Judith, you can stay here." - It's just for a couple of days. - A couple of days? Jack The Ripper just killed a couple of prostitutes. It was still wrong. - Do you want me to put her in a hotel? - Yeah, put her in a hotel. Put her in a space capsule. Put her in a catapult and see how far she flies. Charlie, I can't do that to her. Again, have you even tried? - She's afraid of another quake. - Well, what about what I'm afraid of? - What are you afraid of? - Oh, let's see. Large birds. Small bugs. Unplanned pregnancies. And your ex-wife living in my house. Come on, Charlie. She's just a small, frightened woman. There are no small, frightened women. That's a myth. Perpetrated by the large, angry women who secretly run the world. I think it would be healthy for Jake to see his mother and father living together as friends. Oh, Alan, grow up. As long as he's got pizza with cheese and TV with 150 channels he doesn't give a rat's ass what you guys do. Now that I think about it, neither do I. That had better be a big, pregnant bird covered with spiders. - I don't know how to thank you. - I'm glad you're okay. Charlie, I know this is a big imposition. I really appreciate you inviting me. I thought she should know this was your idea. Actually, I had several other ideas. Wanna hear them? Tell Jake you're here. I'll take your bags. Thank you, Alan. Thank you both. I promise I'll be out of here in a couple of days. - Judith, sit down. I've got it covered. - No. I can pitch in. Where do you keep the salad tongs? Wait, I got them. - Better use the wooden ones. - What's wrong with these? I use those whenever I drop my watch in the toilet. This is a regular occurrence? - You'd think I'd learn. - And you keep them in the kitchen? I used to hang them in the bathroom, but it freaked some chicks out. He's just kidding with you. Use the wooden ones. I don't want any salad. - Well, you have to have some. - Dad doesn't make me have salad. Alan? He's exaggerating. We have salad all the time. I just don't eat it. It's kind of our compromise. Okay. Fine. Your house, your rules. Technically, it's my house, his rules. Of course. Just have a little salad. So I spoke with the plumbing company and they'll be there in the morning. So I'll drop off Jake and meet them on my way to work. - Thank you, Alan. - You're welcome. This is really weird. Why? Your mom and I may not be living together anymore, but we're still friends. I don't flip off my friends when I talk to them on the phone. Nice shooting. Two with one bullet. Well, if either of us did, in fact, do that, it was wrong. The important thing is we're making an effort to be nicer to each other. That's right. And your mom staying here is a good example of that. Very nicely put, Alan. If we leave now, we can be in Mexico in two hours. Hey. Hey. - Where's Alan? - Don't know. Mind if I join you? Sure. Thanks again for your hospitality. Don't mention it. You know, the TV in your room works. Oh, okay. Good to know. I just tucked Jake in. He loves you very much. Yeah. I love him too. You got cable, satellite, DVD. The whole shebang. Great. I'm surprised you're home on a Saturday night. What, with your fun bachelor lifestyle. Well, I got laid this morning. So I thought I'd kick back tonight. Oh, my. Well, isn't that something. - Nice girl? - I guess. She doesn't speak English. Well, hey. What are you guys doing? Just watching a little TV. - What's on? - I don't know. I just sat down. Oh, we've seen this movie before. - No, we didn't. - Sure we have. That guy's girlfriend turns out to be the murderer. Really? I did not know that. Oh, right. And she's not really a girl. I did not know that either. - When did we see this? - The first movie after Jake was born. Oh, right. It was so hard to leave him with the sitter. As soon as we got to the door, the sobbing started. Yeah, well, it was hard for me. You were such a softy. Alcohol. While you're up, you wanna make popcorn? - Sure. - No butter for me. Got it. - Hey, Charlie. - Hey, Rose. Anybody here? Good. Jeez. - I'm sorry. I thought you were asleep. - That's all right. Relax. - You sure? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine. - Where's Alan? - He took Jake to school then went to meet with the plumber. - Right, right. Okay, I'll leave you to it. Charlie, wait. This is your home. Sit down. Drink your coffee. Okay. Oh, and I'm white trash. What are you, a farm animal? - What? - That's your brother's ex-wife out there. I know who she is. Oh, no, no. She's just staying here because of the earthquake. I'm not. I would never. I couldn't. Okay, I could. But I'm not. Yeah. That's what I used to stay about my stepbrother, Cousin Dewey. How's it going? Used to having your mom here? Nope. You? I'm still thinking Mexico. I liked it better when they weren't talking. Can't get away with much when they compare notes. It's hell. Jake, your mom wants to say goodbye. - She's leaving? - Just for a little while. - Where's she going? - Just out to dinner. You know, with a friend. I guess it's a date of some sort. She's going on a date? Of some sort. - And you're okay with this? - Oh, yeah. We talked about it. I think it's a sign of maturity that our relationship has evolved enough that we can be honest that we see other people. Yeah, except the people you're seeing are in magazines and videos. Hey, I told you to stay out of my room. And that's not the point. If I were dating she'd be just as supportive of me as I am of her. We're no longer ex-husband and ex-wife. We are friends getting on with our lives. She's happy and I'm happy. - Okay. I'm leaving. - Oh, have fun. Wow, I'm impressed. What happened to my jealous, tightly-wrapped, neurotic brother? Oh, there he is. Well, well, well. - Alan? - Oh, you remember me? What are you doing up so late? That's funny, I was about to ask you the same thing. Don't tell me you were waiting up for me? This isn't about what I was doing, Judith. No, no. This is about what you were doing until now. I told you I had a date. You said you were fine with it. In theory, I was. In practice, I think we can both see I'm not. What did you want me to do, sit here and do nothing? Why not? It was good enough for me. You know what, you haven't changed at all. You're still the same neurotic, overbearing, control freak I threw out. Neurotic? Maybe. Overbearing? Perhaps. But you know what? You're not gonna throw me out, because I have changed. Tonight, I'm leaving you. As it turns out, a distinction without a difference. Fine, Alan. Suit yourself. Where's Dad? - He's at our house. - How come? Well, we decided we needed a little time apart. Isn't that why you got a divorce? It's hard to explain, Jake. - Do I get any presents this time? - No. What happens now? You gonna live here? - No. - Are you gonna buy a new house? No. Wanna go to Mexico with me and Uncle Charlie? - Good morning. - Good morning. Where's Alan? - Well, it's a long story. - You're not gonna believe it. Hi. I just stopped by to say I told you so. I told you so. Oh, come on, Alan. If you can't laugh at yourself, at least let me do it. What do you want, Charlie? Well first of all, I'd like to know exactly how you managed to let your ex-wife throw you out of my house. Because that's the first thing people are gonna ask when I tell this story. She didn't throw me out, I left. Oh, good, there's a twist. You see, that's what makes a good story. - Leave me alone, Charlie. - Oh, lighten up. You tried to be friends with the woman who wrecked your life and failed. No damage done. Just a little personal humiliation and at this point in your life, how would you even notice that? - Are you finished? - Did I mention I told you so? - Twice. - Counting this one? - Okay, I'm finished. - Thank you. Now, on to new business. Currently, you and I are sitting in a house that belongs to neither one of us. While your ex-wife is sitting in the house that belongs to me. - You see the paradox? - I can't go back there, Charlie. She's running around, having a great time, and I've got nothing. - You've got me. - Drop dead. Okay, now you got nothing. It would be different if Judith and I were both dating. True, but moot. - Unless - What unless? - It's stupid. - Stupider than this? Come on. What do you got? Well, what if you were dating? - But I'm not. - But if you looked like you were? Oh, you mean? No, no way. I'm not gonna let you fix me up with one of your bimbo girlfriends. Okay, forget it. She'd have to be really pretty. Like a 10. And young. Like a 20. - Anything else? - And smart. And a sense of humor is important. Well-read, good with kids non-smoking, of course. Oh, and easy on the piercings. Nothing south of the equator. You're mighty picky for a guy with an adult newsstand in his sock drawer. Okay. Homework is taken care of. He's taking a shower. You may wanna check in on him, make sure he's not goofing around. - Where are you going? - Oh, I have dinner plans. - Really? - Yeah. Hard to believe, huh? - I didn't say that, I'm happy for you. - Well, thank you. Again, I'm sorry I overreacted the other night. I want us to have the kind of friendship that can be mutually supportive. - Me too. - You'll go out, I'll go out. Right. So is this someone you've been seeing for a while? Yeah, a while. But, you know, not exclusive. I don't wanna get tied down. Oh, that must be Camille. - She picks you up? - Well, what can I say? It's a new world, Judith. Hey, wow. You are so good for my ego. - Hi, Charlie. - Hi, Camille. - Hello, I'm Judith. - You're Alan's ex? Wow, I didn't expect you to be so young looking. - Thank you. - I mean, you have such beautiful skin for the mother of an 11 -year-old. Oh, thank you. Okay. Well, we should get going. It was nice meeting you. I just hope I look half as good as her when I'm that old. I'm betting you will. Man, I don't know how he does it. I made a big play for her, nothing. - She's so young. - Yeah, some guys like that. I gotta hand it to you, Judith. You were very mature. I guess that's because you're a very mature woman. Yeah, thanks. Jake, say goodbye to Mommy! She's going home! - Good morning, everybody. - Good morning. Sounds like somebody cracked open the sock drawer last night. I'm going to ignore that because I am in such a good mood. Charlie, thank you. Your ex-wife breaking the sound barrier on her way out was thanks enough. I don't even care about that anymore. That was the best date of my life. I mean, Camille is smart and funny. And, oh, boy, talk about pretty. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I bet she rocked your world in the sack, huh? What? No, no. Get your mind out of the gutter. We just talked all night and then there was a little kissing. Maybe on our next date, who knows? But for now, I'm just gonna play it slow. - You're playing it slow? - Yeah. I don't know where you found Camille, but she's a bit old-fashioned. She's not like the ones you usually go out with. No, I guess not. A thousand dollars a night and he's playing it slow. You're a good brother, Charlie. He's playing it slow. She demanded cash. He's playing it slow. 





                    			- Hey, buddy. - Hi, Uncle Charlie. - Ready for a fun weekend? - He's not gonna have a fun weekend. Charlie, he's gonna study for a history test on Monday. Well, if believing that gets you back in your car, I'll play along. - Where's Alan? - He's not here. Really? I told him I was on my way. That might be why he's not here. Okay, I'll just have to go over everything with you. I'm gonna visit my parents. I won't pick Jake up till Wednesday. Alan has to take him to school. Monday is soccer practice. He has his math tutor and his guitar teacher on Tuesday Hang on. Hang on. Oh, hi, Judith. Alan, why are you avoiding me? - I'm not avoiding you as much as - Hiding. - Thank you. - Why were you hiding? Why does the wounded gazelle hide from the stealthy jaguar? Why does the helpless piglet hide from ravenous wolverine? Animal Planet. You learn a lot. We need to talk about your pain-in-the-ass mother. You know, I would love to but as Charlie told you, I'm not here. - I let her take Jake out to dinner. She brought him home and she lectured me for 15 minutes about his dirty ears. - Fifteen minutes, huh? - How long is this gonna take? Like I'm a bad parent. Let her try and get a Q-Tip in a squirming 11 -year-old boy's ear. Mom didn't believe in Q-Tips. She had a squirt gun. You know, the woolly meerkat of western Africa buries her cubs up to their necks and licks their ears clean. What? It seemed apropos. If she wants to spend time with her grandson she needs to back off. - Okay, I'll tell her. - Thank you. - I'll tell Alan you stopped by. Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what? - I don't remember. - You just read that chapter. Yeah, but Lewis and Clark was a long time ago. Thanks for the ride, Sally. And for getting me home too. - Why is that funny? - It's not. Mustang Sally, giddyup. Now, Lewis and Clark. Face it, Dad, I'm just not good at history. Really? What did you have for lunch yesterday? A pizza square. Actually, two pizza squares, a ice cream sandwich and a bag of Skittles. - Okay, see, that's history. And a Ding Dong and a diet root beer. - Great. - Wait. It wasn't a Ding Dong. - It was a Ho Ho. - Got it. You know what I like? Those big, pink things with coconut. - Snow Balls? - Exactly. Can you still get those? Yeah, but not at the supermarket. You have to go to 7-Eleven. Thank you. Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven? No, we are trying to study. All right, I'll hoof it. - Can I bring you back something? - Ding Dong. Who's there? I'm trying to get him ready for his test. Sorry. Sorry. You go ahead. I'll pretend I'm not here. Okay, Lewis and Clark explored what? Louisiana Purchase. - Right. - I knew that. Yeah, but Uncle Charlie buzzed first. And I'm still buzzed. - Okay, give me another question. - All right. Seward's Folly is another name for? - Jake? - Alaska. - Very good. - Oh, I was gonna say Mrs. Seward. Okay, the score is 1 to 1. Now that you mention it an Eskimo Pie would go down pretty good right now. Alan, will you drive me to 7-Eleven? No, next question: - The War of 1812 - 1812. - No. - 1813. Let me finish the question. The War of 1812 was fought against whom? - The British. - Very good, 2 to 1, Jake. - Yes. - No fair. My buzzer's broken. - Next question. - Let me try yours. See? His works. All right, contestants, we are at the final round. The questions are worth more. - And the answers are harder. - True. - Wait for a question. - Okay. Here we go. Name three changes in American life brought about by the industrial revolution. Populations shift to cities, employment moving from farms to factories, and - Yes? - Sorry, I hit it by mistake. - Settlement of the West. - That's correct. - You are our new champion. - Yes. Settlement of the West. - You see, Jake? You know this stuff. - Yeah, I guess I do. - Trust me, you are gonna do great. - Yeah, thanks, Dad. You're welcome. Now go get ready for bed. - I'll be there in a minute to tuck you in. - Okey-dokey. Oh, I gotta get a security camera. Where's your brother? I wanna talk to him. - He's not here. - Oh, really? No, he's actually not here. You know what his ex-wife said to me? Mom, please go away. She never calls me "Mom," but that was the gist of it. I took Jake out to dinner - You're pretending not to understand me. - Right. And all I did was suggest to Judith that she might wanna pay a little more attention to her son's ear hygiene. Not only was she completely unappreciative but she had the nerve to denigrate how I raised my sons. Yeah, because we turned out so well. Excuse me, but whatever emotional issues you think you have I kept your ears spotless. I remember. You used the same Super Soaker to keep us off the furniture. Ladies and gentlemen presenting noted scholar and A-student, Jake Harper. - You got an A? - I got an A. - All right. Way to go. - Congratulations, Jake. - Thanks. It's my first A this year. - Really? Well, it's none too soon then. - Mom, leave it alone. - I'm not saying anything. I think it's wonderful. Did anybody else in your class get an A? Almost everybody. Why? Oh, I was just curious as to how hard the test was. It doesn't matter, Mom. Still an A. An A is very nice. I just don't know why you're making such a big fuss if they're just handing them out like rubella vaccinations. I don't know. It looks like a pretty hard test to me. - No, it was easy. - That's because you studied. - You earned that A. - Wendy Chow got an A-plus. You hear that? Wendy Chow got an A-plus. Wendy Chow is a freak of nature. She cloned a goldfish for the science fair. We can't compare Jake to her. Who should we compare him to then? The paste eaters and the unibrows? Darling, if you set the bar low in childhood he may never reach the heights he's capable of. You're condemning him to a life of failure and mediocrity. Is that what you want, Jake? A life of failure and mediocrity? No. You see? He may well be sharper than you give him credit for. I'm gonna go to my room. I am putting that A-paper up on the fridge. Wow. Texas used to be a separate country. Why did we change that? Not now, Charlie. How dare you? - Excuse me? - He worked hard on that test. He was finally feeling good about himself and his abilities and in 30 seconds you managed to suck every bit of self-esteem out of him. You're like a - A self-esteem sucker. - Yes, exactly. Alan, I was just having a conversation with the boy. No. No, you don't have conversations. You Suck self-esteem. I would've gotten it. Mom, I am sorry, but I don't think I want you around my son anymore. - What? - You heard me. You will not do to him what you did to me and Charlie. - What did I do to you? What did you do? What did she? Charlie, tell her. Why tell her when we can show her? I see. So you're both turning against me. Oh, I turned a long time ago. Alan's just catching up. All right, fine. If I'm not welcome here I'll leave. My own sons are throwing me out. Goodbye. This isn't over, is it? No, we're screwed. Let me guess. Mom? She's been calling all morning. I'm starting to feel guilty. You can't show weakness, Alan. She'll sense it. Like the hooded cobra senses the rapid heartbeat of a panic-stricken kangaroo rat. But don't you feel even a bit sorry for her? Does the mongoose feel sorry for the wounded garden-snake? Does the dingo feel sorry for the slow-crawling Australian baby? - You guys okay? - Oh, yeah, yeah. We're fine. Why? Your mother just called me. She said she's been trying to reach you all morning and she's very worried. - We're fine, Rose. - We're not talking to her. Why? Because she tried to encourage Jake to live up to his potential? That's a reason to throw her out and slam the door in her face? How could you be so cruel to your own mother? And the dingo has found another Australian baby. Rose, that's not what happened. We were protecting Jake. How? By ripping his only grandmother out of his life? - He has another grandmother. - Oh, right, the Sacramento pill-freak. Is that what she told you? For the record, Jake's other grandmother is out of rehab and doing just fine. We appreciate your concern, Rose. Thanks for stopping by. So now you're just gonna slam the door in my face? Pretty much. Not as satisfying with a glass door. Okay, first she starts with the phone calls then she sent Rose over. I wonder what's next. I don't know, but I'm betting it'll be something big. Right. I understand, it's terrible. Okay, let me see what I can do about it. How in the hell did your mother get my cell phone number? Sometimes, when the nest is threatened  the seemingly docile creatures have been known to eat their own young. Hey, did Mom call you at the office today? No, she call here? - No, it's been pretty quiet. - Yeah, maybe too quiet. And here we see the female praying-mantis  after copulation, devouring her mate. Your ex-wife back from her parents'? Yeah, I dropped Jake off with her this afternoon. Apparently her mom had a little relapse with the pills. - Oh, yeah? - They found her in pajamas driving an imaginary car through the home and garden section of Wal-Mart. How could they tell if she was driving an imaginary car? She rolled down the window to ask for directions to the pharmacy. - Here we witness the - Not Mom. Hello? Yeah, this is Charlie Harper. What? I see. Okay, then. Thanks for letting me know. - Who was that? - St. John's Hospital. Our mother checked in this evening with chest pains and breathing difficulties. - Oh, my God. - Ever wonder who was the first guy to put pineapple on pizza? I bet he was gay. - Charlie - No straight guy is gonna say: "You know what this pizza could use? A pineapple ring." God bless him. It's good. Charlie, is Mom okay? Of course she's okay. She's faking. - How can you be so sure? - It really doesn't make any difference. If she is faking and we rush to see her, she wins. If she's not faking, and we ignore her she complains about what horrible sons we are and she still wins. What if she's not faking and she dies? Well, look at you, Mr. Glass Half-Full. I can't help thinking this is all my fault. I told Mom she couldn't see her grandson and she had a heart attack. Alan, you forget who you're dealing with. This woman buried two husbands and divorced two others. She's lived through wars, riots, earthquakes. Only way you're gonna bring her down is with a stake dipped in holy water. Here we are. Oh, my God. Mommy? Excuse me? - Are you family? - Yeah, we're her sons. Is she gonna be okay? Tell me she's gonna be okay. Your mother's gonna be fine. I can't find a thing wrong with her. - Are you sure? - As sure as I can be. Her heart's fine. Lungs are fine. Blood chemistry's good. EEG's normal. - Oh, thank God. - That bitch. Yeah, tell me about it. Excuse me. I'm gonna tell her she can go home. - Oh, no, please, let us. - Yeah, we owe her that. Suit yourself. Oh, better hurry, though. The nurses are circulating a"do not revive" petition. - You said there was nothing wrong. - It's a big hospital. Things happen. What do we do now? Don't worry. I got a plan. Oh, great, he has a plan. Mom? Charlie? Is that you? Alan's here too, Mom. - Hi, Mom. - Boys, you didn't have to come. Are you kidding? Of course we did. - Right, Alan? - Of course. Tell us what happened. I came home this afternoon, alone. I was walking up the stairs alone. And I had trouble breathing so I drove myself to the hospital alone. - Well, why did you drive yourself? - Oh, I didn't wanna bother the ambulance people. Why didn't you call us? Oh, you both made it very clear how you feel about me. Now, that's not fair. Just tell Jake his Grandmommy loves him very much. Don't talk like that. You can tell him yourself, after the operation. What operation? Relax. Relax. Quadruple bypasses are routine these days. - Quadruple? - Yeah, yeah. You got four clogged arteries. Right, Alan? Right, the doctor said it's lucky you came when you did. Another few days and you'd have been flopping around on the floor like a carp. It's no big deal, Mom. They crack open you open flush out the pipes, sew you back up and you're good as new. Except, you know, for the big, gnarly scar on your chest. They're prepping the OR. We got the best surgeon available. He's young but really sharp. And well-respected in his own country. Well, all right. If it has to be done, it has to be done. I love you, boys. If the worst should happen please remember that. - Yeah. Sure. - Of course. Oh, my God, Evelyn Are you all right? Oh, Judith, is that you? Yes, I'm right here. Jake's here too. Oh, Jake. Come to Grandmommy, darling. I'm sorry you feel bad, Grandma. Oh, Grandmommy's feeling much better now that her little man is here. - I made you a get-well card. - Oh, isn't that nice. Gift shop wasn't open? You said you had a plan. Well, guess what? It was a bad plan. - Alan, calm down. - The plan sucked. - Don't worry. - Don't worry? She's expecting a quadruple bypass. What are we gonna do? We're gonna get her one. Must be someone around here who can handle a rib spreader. - Charlie, that's insane. - You're right. There's no time. Better scrub up. She had to drive herself to the hospital? What is wrong with you two? - Relax, Judith. She's not sick. - What? She's faking and we called her bluff, and then she called ours. So now, we're gonna have to cut her open. You want in? Hey, guess what? After Grandma's operation she's gonna take me to Magic Mountain, okay? Yeah, yeah, that's okay. We're gonna have to tell her. You sure? We don't need to do the bypass. All we do is put her out, slice her open. - The scar will sell it. - The truth, Charlie. Doesn't have to be a big scar. Okay, doctor, let's schedule this as quickly as possible. Oh, great. I'll be here. Hello, boys. - What are you doing? - Lf I'm going to have to have surgery I want my own doctor. Mom, you don't really need a surgeon. Oh, but I do. Your quadruple bypass story makes the perfect cover for a little nip tuck. No turkey neck for Grandmommy, right? About Jake. I told him I'd take him to Magic Mountain but you know how I feel about direct sunlight. Yeah, and wolfbane. You'll take him for me, won't you, Charlie? - Sure, Mom. - I'll make it up to him by taking him out for a haircut and some decent clothes. - He'll like that. - Sure, Mom. Maybe when his mother sees how nice he could look she'll take the hint and stop dressing him like a tackling dummy. Oh, the food here is just dreadful. So why don't you boys run across the street and get me a nice ahi tuna Charlie, what in God's name are you doing? Just practicing. The worker bees, or drones  live a life of utter devotion to their queen. You had a plan. From birth, these industrious yet mindless creatures  slave away to fulfill the queen 's every need. "Don't worry, Alan. I have a plan." Until finally they reach the end of their brief lifespan and die  becoming food and building materials for the rest of the hive. Alan, where's my sandwich? Coming, Mom. A cruel existence? Perhaps. But that's life on the Animal Planet. 





                    			Well, this is gonna be a sucky weekend. Try spending it with an 11 -year-old who does nothing but complain. You mean me? Boy, no wonder they got to write your name in your underwear. What am I supposed to do? - Watch TV. - There's nothing on. - Play a video game. - I've played them all. - Read a book. - Yeah, right. Who's the moron now? Okay. Here's a rainy day activity. There are 12 college basketball games on this weekend. Dial this number, and ask for Coop. Tell him you're calling for Mr. Bojingles and write down everything he tells you. Do I get to make some picks this time? - You got money? - Lf you pay me what you owe me. Well, you're getting an education here. That's priceless. - What's going on? - Just talking about picking colleges. - I like Duke. - Over Wake Forest? Got a hunch. You've got him thinking about college? You're welcome. So how'd it go at the doctor? Sit down, I have to tell you something. What? The doctor wants me to have a procedure. - What kind of procedure? - He says I'm fine and it's routine, but I'm really freaked out about it. What procedure? A colonoscopy. Oh, jeez, Alan, that's no big deal. They're just gonna shove a camera up your ass. Okay, in all future references to this procedure can we please use the word "glide" or "slide" as opposed to "shove." Don't sweat it. Every guy eventually has to get one of those. - It's strictly a fact-finding mission. - You've had one? No, you crazy? But I hear there's nothing to worry about. It's a tiny little camera. In the old days, they'd send a sketch artist up there. Besides, you're unconscious. That's what I'm worried about. I'll be in a very vulnerable position. - They could do anything. - Alan, it's not a pirate ship. Just relax. It'll be over before you know it. Yeah. I'll bet that's what they say on pirate ships. - Damn it. - What? The sink's stopped up again. That kid doesn't know the difference between the garbage and the drain. - What do you want? He's 11. - That's no excuse. If he can't tell which hole is which at his age, he's headed for trouble. How about that? Oh, God, I had the worst nightmares. Pirate ships? Full-service gas stations. I fail to see the connection. Cold steel nozzles going into openings. Dipsticks being pulled out. Do I have to draw you a picture? You know what? You need to get your mind off this colonoscopy. Come on! Get in there, you sucker! Easy for you to say. How about this? How about we hop in the car and go to Vegas for a couple of days? Just like that? What about Jake? Oh, yeah, Jake. Okay, how about this, we get him a fake mustache and a hat and tell everybody his mother was a heavy smoker. - I don't think so. - We can still bring him come on, it's the perfect solution. The kid's bored and you're all puckered up over this colonoscopy thing. It just won't go in. - Well, it is a three-day weekend. - Exactly. And I got 2 grand in my pocket that's itching to turn into $ 12 and a hangover. Come on, we can be there in like four hours. Unless you drive, in which case I'm not going. Perfect, now I can't get it out. You know what? Why not? One way or another I'm gonna get reamed. I might as well enjoy a free buffet. Great. Go grab a toothbrush and we'll hit the road. Pinky? Berta. Order a keg and call the gang, I got the house until Tuesday. Okay, we're gonna need two rooms. One for Alan Harper and son and one for Charlie Harper and a cocktail waitress to be named later. No, I don't want connecting rooms. Weren't you listening? In fact, put mine on a different floor. Come on, let's go. Now, what's playing in your showroom? Nude Legends on Ice. Sweet. Okay, this may sound like a dumb question but is it a family show? Well, what if the kid had a mustache? All right. He'll just have to stay in the room and watch scrambled porn. - You could help me, you know. - No, you're doing okay. - Where's your clean underwear? - I'm wearing it. - That's all you brought for the weekend? - It's only three days. All right, we'll pick some up there. They'd last five days if I turn them inside out. What's going on? Aren't you ready? - I'm packing Jake. - For what, college? - What the hell's this? - So he can go swimming. - Where? - They have pools in Vegas, Charlie. Why don't you bring a frying pan, they got kitchens too. - Let's see. Sport jacket. - He doesn't need a sport jacket. What if we take him someplace nice? Take him someplace nice? Alan, if I wanna throw away money, I'll play keno. - Can I gamble in Vegas? - No. - Why am I going? - Because all the kennels are full. Now, come on. Let's go. - Charlie, I haven't packed myself yet. - What've you been doing? I changed the phone message to tell people we'd be out of town, I put together a first aid kit I turned the fridge thermostat down, because it doesn't have to be cold I called the paper and stopped delivery and I erased an old Mad Libs book so we'd have something to entertain us in the car. - Mad Libs, huh? - Yeah. Let me see that. Go get packed! Wait until you see Vegas, Jake. There's action everywhere you look, How does that help me? I can't gamble, and I have to be in bed at 9:30. Hey, when we go to Disneyland do I complain that I hate every aspect of the entire experience? - Yeah. Well, then you know how irritating it is. - Blackjack. - That's it? Yep. You owe me another dollar. - This stinks. - You wanna quit? Just deal the cards. Attaboy. Uncle Charlie, what's a colonoscopy? - Didn't your dad tell you? - He said it was just a test and it was no big deal, so I looked it up. - And? - I don't believe it. Believe it. Wouldn't it be easier to go in the other way? - You'd think, but no. - Why do they have to do it? - They just wanna see what's going on. - Did Dad lose something? Because when I swallowed 35 cents, we just waited for it to come out. - No kidding. - Yeah, but I only got 30 cents back. Well, the house always takes a cut. - What're you gonna do? - Hit me. Okay, okay. In Vegas, you don't say, "Hit me." If you want a card, you go like this. Okay, fine. - Busted. You owe me another dollar. - What if I didn't want another card? You go like this. That's what I meant to do. There's no do-overs in Vegas. What's the signal to go to the bathroom? There is no signal, you just get up and go. Unless you're on a hot streak, in which case you sit and wet yourself. - You're kidding, right? - You're wearing a $50 pair of slacks and you got $600 on the table, do the math. I have to do math and pee my pants? Alan, are you ready yet? Just about. - And where'd I get the $600? - You've been saying that for 20 minutes. - What are you doing? - Financial planning. I don't wanna look, but I gotta. In class, if we have to go the bathroom, we do this or this. - Get it? - Yeah. I got it. Two hundred and eighty, 280, 280. - What the hell are you doing? - Hang on. Two Oh, thanks. Now you made me lose count. Ten, 10, 10. Twenty, 20, 20. Stop it, stop it. Why are you doing this? - I have a system. - Do tell. I divide my gambling money into three equal piles. The first one is for day one. That I'll put in my money belt. You're wearing a money belt? Oh, good, you can't tell. I was afraid it made me look chunky. Anyway, the second pile is for day two. I'll give that to you under no circumstances do you give it back to me before midnight which would be the start of day two. Un-freaking-believable. What's the last pile for? That's the most important pile. That's the money I hide in my Frye boot. - In your boot? - But I pretend that I don't have it so that if disaster strikes and I've lost piles one and two then I can pull it out, and poof, I'm solvent again. - Okay. I think I understand. - Pretty clever, huh? Yeah. That's a nice boot. - Let me see it. - Oh, sure. Get dressed and let's go! Okay. - Twenty-one! - Turn over your hole card. Oh, 27. Close, 29. Okay, I'm good. Alrighty. Viva Las Vegas. - Oh, Alan. - What? We're going in a Mercedes, not a time machine. Should I change? You should, but after all these years, I doubt you will. - What's this? - Oh, toiletries, sundries, whatnot. - Really. - Yeah, you'll thank me. Not all hotels supply shower caps and sewing kits. Get in the car. Jake, come on. - Hold on a second. - Oh, for God's sake. Now what? Okay, let's go. - Well, you don't have a fever. - I told you, he's fine. Let's go. Charlie, he threw up in your umbrella stand. Did you miss that? So? Vegas is full of people who throw up. They built that city on a sea of vomit. - I'm okay, I can go. - That's the spirit. You wanna drive five hours with a puking kid in the back of your Mercedes? He can stick his head out the window. Let the guy behind us worry. - We're not going. - Oh, come on. - It's probably just something he ate. - All right. What have you eaten in the last 24 hours? Well, let's see, two bowls of Cocoa Puffs a couple blueberry Pop-Tarts, bag of string cheese. That reminds me, we need more string cheese. Then, for lunch, a Hot Pocket and a Bagel Bite. Then dinner, fried chicken, mashed potatoes and a baloney sandwich. Okay, it's not what he ate. Then, for a snack, I had a glass of Tang and some Cheetos. That explains the orange vomit. It's probably a stomach virus. Oh, please. I throw up all the time. It's just nature's way of saying, "Everybody out of the pool." - I'm putting him to bed. Come on. - They have beds in Vegas. - What if he needs a doctor? - They have doctors in Vegas. I bet if we looked around, we could find a casino with a hospital theme. You know, Caesars Sinai or something. I'll get it. Hello? Hey, Mom. Fine. Nothing. I threw up in Uncle Charlie's umbrella stand and we're going to Vegas. - No! What kind of a father are you? I am a good father. When he threw up, I cancelled the trip. But you were planning to take my 11 -year-old to Las Vegas. It's really a family town now. The mob hardly has any influence at all anymore. Oh, good, Charlie. That helps. Were you planning on telling me about this? What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, Mom. Oh, good, Jake. That helps. - Honey, why don't you go lie down. - Why? I'm fine. Is it too late to get our bets down with Coop? - What bets? - Who's Coop? Go lie down. You're delirious. Listen, Judith, I don't think you understand what's going on here. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - You see, this trip was my idea. - I'm shocked. Let me finish. You see, I wanted to cheer Alan up Charlie, don't. It's personal. She has a right to know. Judith, Alan got some bad news from the doctor yesterday. Oh, my God, Alan. What is it? Well, the doctor says I have to have a colonoscopy. - Are you having problems? - No, it's just routine. - So? - So I'm really nervous about it. That's it? Well, it's a long, snaky thing with a camera. Oh, please. Your son was and his head was the same size it is now. That's kind of apples and oranges, isn't it? - Goodbye, Alan. - Wait, wait, wait, Judith. - Aren't you gonna take Jake with you? - No, I'm not taking him. He's fine. Don't think I don't see what's going. You put Jake up to telling me he's sick so you could pawn him off while you went to Las Vegas. He did throw up. Smell the umbrella stand. I'm not buying it. I'll get him Monday night. And if I find out you took him to Vegas you'll get a colonoscopy from my attorney. I've seen your alimony checks. You already got one. So, what's the deal? Are we going? - I don't think so. - Why? I'm fine. - Yeah, but your mom said, "No." - Oh, man. Don't eat anything orange. - You wanna know what I think? - Not at all. I think if she wanted to keep you on a leash she shouldn't have divorced you. - I'm not on a leash. I never was. You were living here for three weeks before you were getting up on the couch without permission. Can we just drop it? It was a bad idea. There are no bad ideas. There's just a lack of will to execute them. We're men, Alan. Single men. We go where we want, when we want and how we want. Usually without so much toiletries but I'm trying to be flexible here. - I explained about the toiletries. The point is, you can't let your ex-wife control your behavior no matter how stupid or self-destructive it might be. - Charlie, l - What profit a man if he escapes the iron shackles of matrimony only to surrender to sexually frustrated tyranny of a vengeful ex-wife? You know what? You're right. - We're men. - Right, are you with me? - I'm with you. - Grab your pack, we're going to Vegas. - Jake? - Just a sec. It's okay. It's mostly water. I'm fine. Let's go. We're men. Nope. You're too sick. Some other time. I'm really sorry I ruined the trip, Uncle Charlie. Hey, it's not your fault. It's your dad who won't let you go. - Thanks, Charlie. - Why should he feel guilty? Here. Put this on Wake Forest. Game's over, Jake. They lost. - What about the spread? - They didn't cover. Give me back my money. Get some rest. - I'm hungry. - Get used to it. - That's some great kid. - Yeah. Sick as a dog, and all he wants is a little action. Well, he gets that from you. You think so? - Because I do try to be a role model. - I know you do. Listen, there's no reason you have to stick around. He's gonna sleep. I can keep an eye on him. No, no, I couldn't go now. Why not? You wanted to go to Vegas. You should go. You're probably gonna have a better time without Jake and me. Probably? Unquestionably. - Then why don't you go? - I don't know. It just feels somehow wrong to abandon the kid when he's sick. Now you know what it feels like to be a parent. How inconvenient. - What's that? - It sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd. Berta? Surprise! I'm gonna start the IV. In a few seconds, you're gonna feel drowsy. No. No drowsy. I wanna be out. Completely out. Don't worry, you will be. - Right, doctor? - Aye. You won't be remembering anything, me bucko. Thanks, doc. Here's the 2 grand for your children's hospital. And remember, when he wakes up, you're a gas station attendant. 





                    			Do you just get up in the morning and figure out ways to make me crazy? Is that what you do? You plot it out? How can I make Alan miserable today? How can I reach into his chest rip out his heart, and suck it dry? - Mom or ex-wife? - Ex-wife. - Hi, Judith. - Charlie says hello. She says hi. You're evil and selfish, you know that? No, no. L I think that is a helpful comment. I pay you alimony and child support so that you can have a nice house a nice car, every weekend free because I've got Jake. And yet you're telling me you need a vacation? Oh, really? Oh, really? And what exactly is stressing you out, Judith? Is it the weekly manicure? The housekeeper? - Boob lift. - The boob lift. - That you paid for. - That I paid for. - And never got to see. - And never got to see. No, no, no. You listen to me. I think you live a damn fine lifestyle that I work 60 hours a week to support. So if anybody needs a vacation, it's not you. It's me! All right, then. Goodbye. Judith's going to Hawaii for a week. So Jake's staying here. I'm shocked. Come on, Jake. It's time to get up for school. I can't go to school. - I'm sick. - What's wrong? I think I have acid reflex disease. Really? Acid reflex disease? Where does it hurt? My head? - Nice try. - My throat? Get up. All right, all right. I just want you to know, I'm starting my day really stressed out. Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like me to send you to Hawaii? That would be nice. What's taking you so long? - I can't find my other shoe. - So put on a different pair. But this one's on already. Hey, what are you doing up so late? It's 7 a.m. - What am I doing up so early? - Where have you been? Searching the kingdom for the woman who fits this shoe. Hey, that's mine. Where was it? In the driveway. Oh, yeah! Okay, let's go. - Got my lunch? - Lunch? - You're supposed to make me lunch. - Oh, crap. This isn't helping my stress level. I forget. Why are you here in the middle of the week? - Because my mom's on vacation. - From what? Me. A word of advice: Don't date women who live near the airport. It's impossible to sleep in. I'll try to remember that. Wish I knew her well enough to bring her back here. Well, maybe next time. Next time? - My lunch ready? - It's right here. What are you doing? - That was for Jake. - I don't see his name on it. Okay, fine. You'Il You'll have half a sandwich and a banana, and maybe an orange, and what the hell, an artichoke. An artichoke? Maybe you can trade it for something good. With who? One of the slow kids? Give it a shot. Tell him it's a puppy. Come on, let's go. I forgot. I have to write five insightful questions I'd ask George Washington. What? Last night you said you had no homework. Dad, I just said I forgot. - Okay, fine. You'll do it in the car. - I was planning on doing math in the car. President Washington. Question number one: "Have you ever thought of coming back from the dead as a zombie?" Jake, I don't think that's what your teacher had in mind. Do you wanna do it? No, no. You're doing fine. Question two: "Can you eat human flesh with wooden teeth?" Hi, Lorraine. I'm running a little late. Could you move my 9:30 to 10, my 10 to 10:30 and, well, you see where this is going. You don't? Hang on, I've got somebody on the other line. Hello. Oh, hi, Mom. Look, I can't talk right now. I'm driving Jake to school. Well, Judith's in Hawaii. No, that does not make me a doormat. Patsy is just another word for doormat, Mom. L Lo I gotta go. I'll call you later. Hi, Lorraine. I'm back. No, no, don't put me on hold. Question three: "Do you think the Revolutionary War would have been won sooner if you had an army of the undead?" This is actually pretty easy. Lorraine, this is Dr. Harper. Listen, I'm I'm gonna be there in about 40 minutes. What do you mean, you're going home? Oh, come on. You were premenstrual two weeks ago. Yes, I keep track. Question number four: "What's your opinion of the new, faster-walking zombies?" No, no, no. Lor Lorraine. Don't cry. Please don't cry. Charlie, I'm going home. How many times have I asked you not to do that? - I'm going home. - I suppose you want me to pay you. Not necessary. I took the money out of your wallet. - Fine. - Guess what? I got a raise. Congratulations. - You wanna know why I got a raise? - No, I'm sure I had my reasons. Because when I took this job, all I had to do was clean up after you. And while that may have been disgusting, it was doable. And then your brother moved in, which I accepted with my usual good humor because he cleans up after himself like a neurotic raccoon. This is about the kid, right? Good for you. That's why you're the boss. He's just here for a week. It's a temporary situation. And yet my raise is permanent. Sounds fair. God, what a horrible day. - Tell me about it. - Show of hands: Who spent their day pre-soaking the shorts of a kid who leaves more skid marks than a getaway car? That's what I thought. Now, if you ladies will excuse me I have three buses to catch. I bet she catches them by hand. Yeah, well, I have my own problems. I was late for work, my receptionist went home early because, apparently, she has the reproductive cycle of a jackrabbit and then I had a large, drunk Samoan man walk in who thought that chiropractor means "massage with happy ending." I kept trying to crack his back and he kept rolling over and winking at me. - Wow, that's creepy. - Tell me about it. So you're gonna see him again? Or should I say, are you gonna see him Samoa? Oh, come on. That was funny. Oh, yeah. It's hilarious. You know what your problem is? - You don't drink enough. - You're probably right. This is the first time today I've had a chance to just sit down and decompress. - Cheers? - Oh, cheers. Oh, that's good. I keep having this nagging feeling that I forgot something. - Lf you forgot it, it wasn't important. - Yeah, I guess. I can't believe you forgot me. I said I'm sorry. You forgot me. I know. I feel terrible. How many kids you got? - There's a towel on the floor, buddy. - I'm okay. I want you to sit on it so you don't leave a wet ass-print on my leather seats. You forgot me too. Yeah, but I'm just your uncle. He's your father. Yeah, my own father. Thanks, Charlie. Is there any way I can make it up to you? - You wanna go out for a special dinner? - No. - How about a movie? - Why? You're gonna leave me there too? For the last time, I am sorry. Won't be the last time. I just wanna go home. I'm cold and I'm wet. If you kick the back of my seat again, you're gonna be colder and wetter. Ease up on him. He's had a rough day. Yeah, my dad left me out in the rain. I'm sorry. What did I tell you? What's all this stuff on the floor? I don't know. Junk mail. Parking tickets. - What's this? - Satin blindfold. - For what? - What do you mean, "For what"? In case I run into a piata. - You're unbelievable. - Don't judge. You felt up a Samoan dude. Hey, this is for me. From the IRS. It was mailed a month ago. Damn post office. Oh, perfect. - Just freaking perfect. - Good news? I'm being audited. They wanna see me tomorrow. Oh, well, look at the upside. What upside? Yeah, okay, you got me. How could you forget to give this to me? I don't know. How could you forget your only son in the rain? - Yeah. - Yeah. Watch the cleats. Let's go, sleepyhead. Rise and shine, up and at 'em. Get out of my room or I'll kill you with my bare hands. I'm being audited today. You have to take Jake to school. Put him in a cab. Oh, please. I am counting on you. Then you're headed for disappointment. You need to get Jake dressed, make him his lunch and get him to school by 8, okay? - Okay. - You're not moving. - Yes, I am. I'm flipping you off under the covers. Get up! All right, I'm up. So you know what to do with Jake? You have to be responsible. You have to be me today. - Think you can handle that? - You left him out in the rain yesterday. It's not like you set the bar real high. - Charlie. - Relax. I think I'm capable of getting your kid to school. Good, because I really need your help. So So I'm gonna leave now. You're all set, right? Charlie? Get up! Get dressed. I'm taking you to school. I can't. I'm sick. Yeah, well, bite me. - Hey. - Don't Don't screw with me, shorty. I only got, like, nine hours of sleep last night. - Now get dressed. - I'm supposed to take a shower first. Sit near a window. - Here, put these on. - I wore these yesterday. They're still extremely stylish. Put them on. - Can I have some privacy, please? - For what? You're 11. That's close to puberty. Okay, okay. I'm leaving. What am I, nuts? Get up! I could have dressed myself, you know. You had your chance. I look stupid. Yeah, well, you're close to puberty. Oh, I forgot to comb my hair. No, no, no. I'll do it. That's spit. Hey, one man's saliva is another man's mousse. Now shut up. There, you're beautiful. Let's go. - What about lunch? - Sorry, I have plans. No, you're supposed to make me lunch. Oh, all right, come on. You're not really a morning person, are you? You're just saying that because I spit on your head. - You like cold pizza, right? - Sure. - This is frozen. - Yeah. If you sit on it it'll thaw by lunch. My butt is freezing. You wanted pizza. All right, I'll put the seat warmer on. Cook it from both sides. - I like it better when my dad takes me. - Oh, gee, you're not having fun? Because I'm farting rainbows over here. First, he forgets me. Now he leaves me with you. Hey, you know what? Your father works like a dog to make sure you have everything. If he's not there for you it's just because he's trying to stay out of federal prison. I think he needs to have sex. I was kidding about prison, Jake. What do you mean he needs to have sex? Well, he's been really grumpy lately. You're usually in a good mood. I figure it's because you have sex. Jake, it takes more than sex to make a man happy. You also need money. All right, have a good day. - Learn something. - This isn't my school. - What do you mean? - I mean, I don't go to school here. Well, where do you go to school? Woodward Avenue Elementary. - And where the hell is that? - Woodward Avenue, I guess. I don't know why you can't tough it out here for one day. Make some new friends. Hey, Alan, it's Charlie. Look, I wanna ask you something but I don't want you to read anything into it. Where exactly is Jake's school? You don 't know where his school is? What the hell is wrong with you? - Are you trying to kill me? - You could be right about the sex thing. Okay, Woodward Avenue Elementary School. Looks like they're closed. That's because I'm an hour late. Even the crossing guard is gone. How about this? Why don't you just bag school and we'll go catch a movie. - I can't skip school. I'm in the play. - What play? The founding fathers' play. You'll be there, right? Why would I be there? Because Mom's in Hawaii and Dad's got that tax thing and you're all that's left. Oh, I'm all that's left. Hey, I'm not thrilled about it either. Okay. Where and when? In the auditorium after lunch. Oh, yeah. I need a Ben Franklin costume. You're telling me this now? I told Mom but she's in Hawaii. All right. Let's see. Washington, Jackson, Lincoln. Here we go. Benjamin Franklin. Why can't you be Lincoln? A beard, a mole, a top hat, we're done. Because Lincoln wasn't a founding father. Okay, I'll see what I can do. Now get out of here. Hey. You forgot your lunch. Hey. God, what a day. I don't wanna hear it. You know why I was being audited? Not because I have unsubstantiated deductions. Which I have. Not because I take the occasional cash payment from a client and forget to report it. Which I do. It was because no one at the IRS could believe I was paying as much alimony as I claimed. It took me three hours to convince them that, yes I am that big a schmuck. Oh, boo-hoo. You want a real fun time? Try finding an extra small Ben Franklin costume at 9:00 in the morning. Oh, right. The play. How was it? Boffo. A smash. Among the highlights were a 12-year-old Chinese George Washington with a powdered wig and a snot bubble and your kid in a bald cap and granny glasses holding a Tweety Bird kite and announcing he's discovered elasticity. - Oh, I wish I'd seen it. - Don't worry, you will. It was videotaped from about 150 different angles. I should tell him I'm sorry I wasn't there. - Yeah, you should. - Is he in his room? Here you go, pal. Your favorite. Bacon double cheeseburger and cheese fries. And for dessert, I got fudge brownies with that ice cream you like. Is this supposed to make up for everything? - Yeah. - Pretty much. Look, Jake, I know it's been rough and I'm sorry. We're human, we make mistakes. But I promise you neither of us will ever, ever forget to pick you up again. Yeah, I still wanna go back to Mom's. When is she coming home from Hawaii, anyway? Oh, crap. 





                    			Here. This is for you. Thank you. And I didn't get you anything. It's your kid's toilet seat. It's obviously in his way, and I'm tired of cleaning it. Oh, come on, Berta. - He's 11. - He's a pig. I'll talk to him. While you're at it, you may wanna mention the half-eaten egg salad sandwiches in his toy chest the dead marine life at the back of the closet and the booger collection under the bed. I'll do my best to address your concerns. Don't condescend to me, Zippy. I'll snap you like a butter bean. Excuse me. Is one of you Alan? I'm Alan. Oh, good. Charlie wants you to come upstairs. - Why? - Well, it's kind of hard to explain. - Try. - Oh, yeah, try. Well, he's kind of stuck. - In what? - In what? Not in anything, just stuck. Would you hurry? - Where are you going? - Oh, like I'm gonna miss this? Charlie? Are you okay? Do I look okay? - What happened? - I pulled my back. I didn't do anything. I was lying there and he started screaming. - I understand. - I mean, I wasn't just lying there. - I got it. - Damn, I wish I had a camera. That's okay. It's all on video. Alan, you're a chiropractor. Do something. Really? You want my help? Even after you referred to my profession as, what was it "urban voodoo"? I'm sorry. Now help me. Okay. Okay. We'll see what we can do. Yeah, yeah, okay, very funny, very funny. Hold on. Berta, I'm gonna need a dead rooster. Check your kid's room. Excuse me, Charlie, sorry you're not feeling well, but I have an audition. - Go. - It's a Wheat Thins commercial. - I'm an actress. - Of course you are. I had a nice time, Charlie. - I'll call you. - Great. Oh, if you find my tongue stud, let me know. Okay, let's see what we've got here. - Is this tender? - A little. - On a scale of one to ten? - I don't know. Three? - Okay, what about this? - Four. And what about this? I'm gonna need a number, Charlie. No, no, I changed my mind. Leave me alone. Oh, don't be a baby. - Stay away. - I have to examine you. - It's okay. I'm better. - No, you're not. - Now, stop moving. - Really, I'm fine. Just don't Ten. Ten. That's a ten. - Are you happy? - Do I look happy? Let's get you back on the bed so I can give you an adjustment. No, no, no, no. New plan. I need someone who can give me drugs. I'm not holding, but I can make a couple calls. Drugs just mask the problem. Fine, mask it. Throw a cape on it, and let it fight crime. I just want it to go away. Good news. I think I know where Wheat Thins lost her tongue stud. For the love of God. Oh, mommy. Feeling better? No, I just passed out for a second. Berta, I'm gonna take Charlie to the doctor. - You keep an eye on Jake. - Fine. Whoa, hey. And please put his toilet seat back on. I really think you should put on your seat belt. Do you now? Did you forget it took three of us just to put on my shorts? Suit yourself. I should call your doctor and tell him we're coming. - What's his number? - I don't know. All right, I'll call directory assistance. What's his name? Where's he located? Dr. Schwartz. Beverly Hills. - You're kidding, right? - Do I look like I'm kidding? Well, I need a first name. I remember his receptionist's name. Julie. Cute redhead with a slight speech impediment. She called me "Charlie." I almost asked her out once but I couldn't face the inevitable phone calls. "I love you, Charlie. Don't leave me." Yeah, yeah, and your doctor's first name is? Oh, I have no idea. Idiot. Yes, Beverly Hills, California. Dr. Schwartz. Yeah, I don't know the first name. No, I'm not kidding. There are 128 Dr. Schwartzes in Beverly Hills. What street is he on? Wilshire Boulevard, I think. Wilshire Boulevard, we think. Okay, we're down to 47 Schwartzes. Just forget it. Drive down Wilshire. I'll know the building when I see it. Never mind, we're gonna play Find the Jewish Doctor in Beverly Hills. Wait, wait. There it is. Now, you see, that wouldn't have happened if you'd been wearing your seat belt. Alan, if I can ever use my legs again the first thing I'm gonna do is kick your ass into your throat. That's not Julie. - So? - It's just important to me that you know. - Can I help you? - Yeah, I'm Charlie Harper. - I need to see my doctor. - Do you have an appointment? No, but this is an emergency. He has to get back to Notre Dame and ring the bell. Oh, I get it. He's hunched over. That's funny. Yeah, can I see my doctor, please? - Who's your doctor? - Dr. Schwartz. - Stanley Schwartz? - Yes, Stanley. - It's Stanley. - Thank you. When was the last time you were here? I don't know. A couple of years ago. Why? - Dr. Schwartz passed away. - Oh, no. So where's Julie? Julie we had to let go. She was playing a little fast and loose with the old prescription pad. I'm guessing Valium. Is there somebody else who can see him? Yeah, but not Dr. Schwartz's doctor, okay? Dr. Talmadge took over Dr. Schwartz's practice. It's a little tight right now, but I could squeeze you in. That's kind of how this happened. Oh, my. So this was a sexual injury. Well, thank goodness you're okay. This is really gross. Why do I have to do it? - You want your toilet seat back? - Yes. Then keep scrubbing. You know, taking it wasn't funny. I could have broke my butt. Oh, come on. How could that not be funny? Don't forget to clean on the outside. That's all you. - And the floor, and the wall. - Okay, okay. How in the hell did you hit the wall anyway? I don't know, it just gets away from me sometimes. After a day scrubbing toilets I'm betting you'll be able to pee through a Cheerio at 10 paces. Oh, God. Oh, jeez. Hey, guess what. The Soviet Union is boycotting the Olympics. My pain is just a big joke to you, isn't it? I offered to help you, Charlie, and you refused, so yeah. I'll tell you, if you came to me as a patient in this much pain I wouldn't make you wait. I'd see you right away. So would my dry cleaner, but I don't let him touch me either. I could help you, Charlie. I've already isolated the source of your discomfort. All that's left would be to realign your vertebrae through a gentle series of manipulations and stretches thereby alleviating your pain. Well, you didn't explain it like that. That's different. - So you'll let me work on you? - Not in a million years. Fine. Worship at the altar of the American Medical Association. Swallow the pharmaceutical companies' propaganda. I'll swallow it, I'll sniff it, I'll insert it rectally. Anything to kill the pain. I'm dying here. Mr. Harper, I'm Dr. Talmadge. Hello, doctor. Hallelujah. It's a miracle. So I see you're having some back pain. That will be $ 100, please. Yeah, it started in my back but now it's kind of radiating out into a body-wide unbearable agony. You have a really cute little nose, you know that? - Did the pain start in your lower back? - Best I can tell it's a spasm between L4 and L5. - Oh, are you a doctor? - Yes, I'm a chiropractor. So no. How did this happen? Well, I slipped. On an actress. I can handle this, Alan. Okay, see, the thing is, I was in the middle of An actress. I'm warning you. - Do the details really matter? - No, no, I think I got the picture. There's video if you need it. Keep it up. Okay, I see here your last visit was four years ago. A mild hernia brought about by Okay. I think I'm seeing a pattern here. He's a sexual compulsive with narcissistic tendencies. Oh, so you're a pretend psychiatrist too. So, what's the course of treatment here? A pill, a shot? Maybe one of those epidurals? First I'm going to get your blood pressure and take x-rays. - I take blood pressure and x-rays. - Your mother must be very proud. Actually, no. Someone will be in to take you to x-ray. Wait. I'm still in pain. Try and hang in there. In the meantime maybe your little buddy can give you a massage. - Can you believe her? - Yeah, she is something else. Please don't tell me you're interested in that condescending arrogant excuse for a woman. Pardon me, Alan, but that is a condescending arrogant, hot excuse for a woman. She's just your typical obnoxious MD. I'm a doctor. I have special license plates. I can park wherever I want. I know where I wanna park. You're unbelievable. Does your penis have an off switch? A pause button? No, just a little freckle. You're always telling me I should date a better class of woman. What's classier than a doctor? Oh, please. Four years of med school, two years of internship a year of residency, and everybody thinks they're so special. But I'll tell you something. A new day is dawning. A day of reckoning. And it is spelled HMO. No more country clubs. No more Cadillacs. Just sky-high insurance premiums and low, slow, copay reimbursements. Just like the rest of us. I'll bet she knows a lot of secret anatomy stuff. You know, places you touch and the top of your head flies off. If you have sex with a doctor, there's a chance they'll split in the middle of the night for an emergency. Well, that's just a price you'll have to pay. No, no. That works for me. Okay, I finished the toilet, the shower and the sink. - What took you so long? I went to the bathroom, and I had to start over. Take these, and get started on the kitchen floor. Why? I didn't pee in here. Okay, once, but it was in the sink. The sink? How'd you manage that? It's not that hard. You just gotta drink a lot of root beer, lean back and figure the angle. So tell me about Dr. Talmadge. - Is she seeing anybody? - Yes. - Is it serious? - Dog bite. - No, I mean - Charlie, give it a rest. What? You're sitting here in pain because of a casual sexual encounter and now you're trying to drum up another one. - Yeah, so? - Don't you get it? Your entire life is about jumping from one shallow, meaningless relationship to the next. And? You're a grown man. You can't go through life drinking and partying and humping anything that doesn't shake you off. Yes, I can. But sooner or later, it's gonna catch up to you. Eventually, you will have to pay the piper. - Who says? - Everybody says. Really? Because I'm just hearing you. If 2000 years of human history has taught us anything it's that there is karmic justice in the world and that when people live the way you do bad things happen to them to even things out. Well, I don't agree. It's not up for debate. It's a law, like gravity. Oh, I agree with gravity. Good, we wouldn't want you flying off the planet with nothing to hump but satellites. If it makes you feel better, something bad happened. - I'm in excruciating pain. - That's not enough. Trust me, Charlie. The piper has yet to be paid. The only question is how high a tab you want before the bill comes due. Okay. I get it. Well, good. So you think I have a shot with that doctor, or what? It's like trying to talk Shakespeare to a Hershey bar. Who's Piper? Oh, you poor, clueless bitch. Never trust a drifter with an eye patch. - Berta. - What? I'm tired, and my hands are all red and pruney. I've seen your grades. Get used to it. How do I know when I'm done? Don't worry about that, honey, I'll tell you. Oh, for God's sakes, don't kiss him. He's your brother. - I have x-rays. - Oh, good. Let me see them. Oh, golly, no. Only for a doctor. Hey, I'm a doctor. Oh, yeah? Where you parked? Alan, you gotta relax. You're harboring the kind of resentment that eats away at your insides until you wake up one day peeing blood and crapping into a bag. Thanks for the advice. You know the difference between you and me? I have a functioning liver and somehow, you're gonna get laid tonight. That's ridiculous, Alan. She's an educated professional. Probably gonna have to throw a few fancy meals at her first. Boo-hoo, you'll have to wait a couple of weeks. Couple of weeks? Anyway, the difference between you and me is that when life gives me lemons, I make lemonade. When you get lemons, you just bite into them and suck them inside out. Okay. Let's see what we've got. No fractures, no dislocations. - Looks like just a simple muscle spasm. - Between L4 and L5? Oh, good for you. Okay, I am gonna give you a shot, which should ease the pain and also allow your muscles to relax. Have you had Demerol before? No, but I've heard nice things about it. Okay, I'm just gonna pull your shorts down a little. But Dr. Talmadge, I don't even know your first name. - Michelle. - Michelle. That's prettier than Stanley. - Sorry. - That's okay. It's all part of the little meet-cute thing we got going here. So how long does it take before I start feeling happy. Happy, happy, happy. Happy. Michelle, did you know I have a house on the beach? - Really? I love the beach. - Oh, good, because I have a house there. Wait outside, I need to give your brother a hernia exam to make sure he hasn't reinjured the area. - A hernia exam. - And your boxers. - Bye-bye, boxers. I was wrong. There's no justice. I thought there was justice, but there's not. What, you think there's justice? Because there's not. Turn your head and cough. - You have very warm hands. - Again. You have very warm hands. So any chance I could take you out for dinner tonight? - You're hitting on me? - You started it. - You're amazing. - Well, statistically I'm only slightly above average. But I make up for it with enthusiasm and perseverance. No, what's amazing is that you don't remember me. Well, sure I remember you. You're the pretty woman cupping my testicles from earlier. Back when I was in medical school, you and I went out for a couple months. You wanna loosen your grip there? Then for reasons I never understood you stopped calling me, and started seeing my roommate. The grip. I always hoped I'd run into you again. Please. Just leave me one. Oh, dear God. My brother's making lemonade. I need to go to the bathroom. So go. Oh, yeah. Good night. I'll see you tomorrow. - Night. - Night. So, are you gonna tell me what happened with you and the doctor? What do you think happened? I think she shot you full of drugs you dropped trou, she jumped your bones and you're the luckiest bastard to walk the earth. Well, for your information that's exactly what happened. Not even a little justice. This is a justice-free zone. Looking for justice? Sorry, fresh out. Enjoy sucking on that lemon. Nope, not yet. 





                    			Some side effects include headaches, blurred vision, and high blood pressure. Ask your doctor if it's right for you. - Dad? - Yeah? Do you suffer from erectile dysfunction? Well, Alan? Do you? Jake, wh What do you know about erectile dysfunction? It's something to do with your penis, right? - Right. - And they say one out of three guys gets it, and mine's fine, so it's gotta be one of you. - I'm fine. - Not me, l So, what are the pills for? Well, what they do, Jake, is that they They dilate the blood vessels which allows more blood to easily flow to certain They're boner pills, Jake. To get them, or to make them go away? To get them. Go get ready for bed. What's the point? They're not good for anything. You ever try any of those drugs? Once or twice. Out of curiosity, not necessity. - What did you think? - Not my thing. It's like corking the bat. You? Yeah, that's what my ex-wife wanted. More sex with me that lasted longer. Hello. Oh, hey, Eric. Hiya. What's happening, boyfriend? Oh, you're terrible. Do you kiss your mother with that mouth? So, what's up? Saturday? Let me check my book. Saturday is marvelous. How dressy? Eveningwear, or California casual? Oh, goody. An excuse to shop. Like I need one. Okey-dokey, artichokey. Ciao for now. - What? - Something you wanna tell me? That? Oh, that's Eric. He's the head of a big ad agency. - Throws a lot of jingle work my way. - He wouldn't be gay, would he? What difference does it make? A person's sexuality is a personal thing. It has no relevance in the business world. - But he is gay. - Oh, yeah. You know, it's okay to call them queer again. Good to know. Good to know. Would it fair to assume that you've led him to believe that you are of a similar persuasion? Not deliberately. I kind of sort of backed into it. - Excuse me? - Okay. Poor choice of words. When we first met, I found myself falling into his What do you call it? Futon? No, no, his manner of expressing himself. Tone, gestures. Like talking to a Southerner you start saying "y'all" and "grits" and "tobaccy." - Oh, Charlie. - It's harmless. He throws me work. I want him to feel comfortable with me. And how far do you go to make him feel comfortable? Don't worry. I just sparkle a little bit. I don't burst into flames. - I don't know how you live with yourself. - Actually, I don't live with myself. I have a significant other. - What? - We're both invited to a cocktail party Saturday night. What? - No. Absolutely not. - Oh, come on. You always complain we don't hang out. I didn't mean I wanted to date you. You don't think I'm gonna go to a gay cocktail party stag, do you? The way I sparkle? I'm not going to be your gay lover so you can make a few bucks. Okay, first of all, it's considerably more than a few bucks. This man was responsible for almost half my income last year. And that's the half I didn't gamble away. And second of all, you're not just my lover you're my life partner. That makes you special. Forget it. It's immoral and deceitful, and I don't want any part of it. What's the big deal? Gay people pretend to be straight. They don't wanna be discriminated. And neither do I. The minute this guy finds out I'm a breeder, I'm history. I don't care. If you wanna engage in a fraudulent escapade have one of your oafish poker buddies be your partner. You see? You see? Right there. Escapade. Oafish. What poker buddy of mine talks like that? But you, a couple of squirts of Paco Rabanne, you're good to go. Having a reasonable command of English isn't the exclusive domain of the gay community. Listen to you. You're just making my point. Forget it. You're asking too much. Oh, really? Was it too much when you showed up on my doorstep, looking for a place? - Charlie. - Too much when I took in your son on weekends and holidays? - This isn't fair. Too much when I set up a college fund for Jake? - You set up a college fund for Jake? - You bet I will. Unless, of course, my income were to suddenly decline. I can't believe you would sink so low. To actually use emotional and financial blackmail - You're both in my will. - Really? First thing Monday. All right. But I want it on the record I'm doing this under protest. - Noted. If we're gonna be a couple, I'm the husband. Well, who's gonna believe you're the husband? Of the two of us, I'm the only one who's been a husband. You really thought you were the husband in your marriage? Nevertheless, I'm going to be the husband in this one. Well, la-di-da. - Thanks for babysitting, Rose. - My pleasure. Where are you guys going? To a little party. And you're taking Alan instead of a date? Yeah, well, funny story about that. Okay, let's get this over with. You're wearing that? What's wrong with it? You liked it in the store. It looked different in the store. Well, it was on sale. I can't return it. - Dad, can we order pizza for dinner? - No. Eat something healthy. You want me to change, just tell me. - Don't change. - You don't like it. I didn't say that. I think you look very nice, Alan. Thank you. See? That's all I needed to hear. - Well, you heard it. Now, come on. - You know, I'm only doing this for you. - I know. - Could you show a little appreciation? How about I show you a little smack on the head? That's your answer for everything, isn't it? What is that about? I don't know, but one of them suffers from erectile dysfunction. Dad said we could order a pizza. Would you please not walk so far in front of me? I'm not your concubine. I'm sorry. What, are you ashamed of me? A little bit. Oh, boy. Charlie, we need to talk. For the last time, you look stunning. No, we We need to get our stories straight. - What stories? - We're a couple. How long have we been together? How did we meet? Okay, fine. I met you in Thailand and bought you from a guy. I'm serious. If we're gonna pull this off, we need to be convincing. A favorite song? Cute names for each other? I mean, I don't even know if we're dog people or cat people. I forgot to tell you: The guy I bought you from had your vocal chords removed. - Charlie. I'm so glad you could make it. - Oh, please. How could I not? And you must be Alan. Welcome. I'm the husband. No, he's not. Stop saying that. Listen to you two ladies. Come on. I'll get you a drink. Appletinis. So how did you lovebirds meet? Funny you should ask. We were at the Coffee Bean you know, the one in Larchmont Village, where the pastries are to die for. Anyway, we both ordered a soy latte when the first one came up, we both reached for it, and our hands touched. Oh, that is so romantic. Yeah, it was one of those moments that seems to go on forever. Like this one. - Are you starting? - No. Because I swear to God, I will walk out that door and get in a cab. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, what? I'm sorry pookie. Finish your story, Alan. Well, okay. So So there we are our hands are touching, and we look into each other's eyes this one panics, spills coffee over one of his hideous bowling shirts. The only gay man in America who dresses like Ralph Kramden. To the moon, Alan. Anyhoo, so I took him back to my condo to "hand wash his shirt" and, abracadabra, hocus-pocus, here we are. - That's a delicious story. - Yeah, isn't it yummy? Yeah, it kills me every time. There's someone you just have to meet. Don't go away. Okey-dokey, artichokey. You've gotta pull back a little. You're gonna set off the smoke alarm. - What do you mean? - I mean, if you flame any more you'll light the drapes on fire. What about you? "Okey-dokey, artichokey"? What are you, the Jolly Gay Giant? I want you both to meet someone very special to me. Charlie, Alan this is my very patient and very forgiving ex-wife, Pamela. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Hi. Wow, you were married? It was before I'd gotten a grip on my sexuality. But not before you got a grip on my cousin Walt. Well, I can see why you gave marriage a shot. Pamela, you are a breathtakingly beautiful woman. Why, thank you, Charlie. Why do all the cute ones have to be married or gay? Back off, sister. I caught this fish. - Gonna tell me what's bothering you? - Lf you don't know, no point discussing. Fine. You ignored me the whole night. A party where I don't know anyone, and you abandoned me. Alan, listen closely. It wasn't a real date. Not the point. I was stuck playing truth or dare with your friend Eric and nine producers from Will & Grace while you had a wonderful time talking to his hot ex-wife. - I was just being polite. - Oh, please. - I saw the way you were looking at her. - What, I can't look? Not when you're supposed to be with me. How many appletinis did you drink tonight? Never you mind about that. So So, what are you gonna do? Out yourself as a straight man so you can sleep with your little Pamela? No, no. That would mess everything up with Eric. Unless I convince him that she temporarily flipped me back to the home team. Oh, if you're gonna go, just go. Alan, eat something. Toast, a waffle. Anything absorbent. Don't blame this on the liquor. Okay, here's what I can do. She and I are going shopping tomorrow. I'll tell her I'm bisexual, and then make my move. So you're gonna cheat on me? No, that's not cheating. - How do you figure? - Because we're not really gay. Then how can you be bi? Shut up. Okay, well, good night. - Aren't you gonna ask? - No. Jake told me. Oh, this is a cute top. I'm more a bottom man myself. I'll bet you are. - Too slutty? - Haven't you heard? Slutty is the new black. Oh, you. Is there some special, young vagina enthusiast you'll be taking that off for? I wish. Can you keep a little secret? I'm keeping a big one right now. I haven't been with a man in almost a year. Oh, no. Color me sympathetic. I don't miss dating. That's lies and pretense. I do miss the sex. Really? Well, what, specifically, do you miss? And tell me slowly. The feel of a man's hot breath on the back of my neck. His rough hands pulling me to him and just taking me. Of course, I don't need to tell you. No, but I'm so glad you did. Isn't it funny that I can only be this honest with a gay man? Yeah, it's a riot. Straight men only want one thing, and they'll tell any number of lies to get it. - The dogs. - Straight women are so competitive they'll use anything you say against you. The bitches. Gay women only want one thing, and they'll lie worse than straight men. Strange, because they've already got it. Oh, you, come here. Oh, that's the other thing about gay men. You're so hilarious. Yeah, we're like clowns who smell nice. You know, these are pretty. It's pretty sheer. Eric hated it when he could see my nipples. That a gay thing? Well, I can't speak for the community, but I myself am nutty for nipples. Let's try it on. Okey-dokey, artichokey. All right. Hold this. Okay. What do you think? With or without the bra? I don't know. You're the one with nipple issues. All right, then. Without. Yes. Definitely without. Am I starting to sag? What I'm sorry, were you talking to me? Am I hanging a bit low? I don't know. Go like this: - Now go like this: - Stop it. Give me the blouse. I am a woman, Charles. - Wanna see my nipples? - No. Why not? You made me look at yours. God, you are so frisky. How does Alan ever put up with you? How does his mother put up with him? Oh, boy. Charles, didn't I ask you to confine your debauchery to outlet stores? Pamela, this is my mother, Evelyn. Mom, this is Pamela. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Your son is adorable. That seems to be the conventional wisdom. I met him and his partner last night, but we immediately hit it off. - I'm sorry. His partner? - Alan, his lover. His lover? God, I'm not outing you, am I? Oh, no, no, no. Mom knows all about me and Alan. Right, Mom? Of course. Alan's almost like a son to me. My ex's parents were not supportive when he came out of the closet. Oh, what a shame. What does he do? He's in advertising. Charlie writes jingles for him. Oh, I see. One hand moisturizes the other. No, the only time Charlie was ever in the closet was when he was a little boy trying on my hats and underwear belting out the entire score of Hello, Dolly! It was Mame, Mom. In fact, if anything, his lifestyle has brought us even closer. We cook together, we shop together we go to all kinds of parties and charity events together. Come to think of it, I have entered us in an Alzheimer's walkathon this Sunday. Sunday isn't really good for me. But you will be there anyway because we support each other in all our little causes, and you love me. Right? Right. Say it. I love you, Mom. And I love you too. Eight a.m. Sunday. I'll buy us matching tracksuits. It'll be cute. - Lovely to meet you, Pamela. - Bye. If I didn't know you were gay, meeting your mother would've convinced me. Okay, that's it. I can't do this anymore. You can't stop shopping. I've gotta find you something slutty. I've already got something slutty in my pants. - You're terrible. - Pamela, listen to me. I'm not gay. I am completely, and I find you incredibly attractive. - Okay. I understand. - You do? - Of course. I went through this with Eric. He wanted badly to be straight, and he suffered so much before he was able to finally accept himself for who he is. Oh, no. I accept myself for who I am. I am a lying horndog. - Charlie. - Lf I were a straight man would you find me attractive? - That's hypothetical. Play along. Humor me. If I were straight I'd do you in a heartbeat. Oh, good. Come with me. Charlie, don't do this. You don't have to prove anything. Oh, but I do. Now, come here. You don't have to be straight to be a good kisser. I know, I know. Just wait. Well? Give me a minute. I'm under some pressure here. I just saw my mother. Would it help if you thought of Alan? Oh, great. Why don't you just roll up a newspaper and hit it? Charlie, sweetheart, it's okay. No, it's not. I am a straight man. I've always been a straight man, and I'll always be a straight man. Well, you'll forgive me, darling, but you seem to have a gay man's penis. Come on, let's go look at shoes. It's a straight man's penis. It's just having a bad day. - Hey. - Oh, I thought you'd never come home. - We have to talk. - Not now. I need to drink beer, scratch my ass and watch a whole bunch of girl-on-girl porn. - Hello, Charlie. - Eric. What are you doing here? I came over to talk to you about a new account, and you weren't here, so So he invited me to Big Sur for the weekend. It's not what it sounds like. Yes, it is. He looked into my eyes, told me I had a tight little breadbasket. No. Look, the other night at the party, there was a lot of friction between you and I'm really sorry. Yeah, I'll bet you're really sorry. How do you expect me to keep working for you? Gosh, I hope you will. I'll make it up to you. How? How could you possibly make up for this incredible betrayal? - I'll get you more money. - Done. Get out. Bye, Alan. Thanks for the sweater. - He gave you a sweater? - Cashmere. Very stylish. And thank you. - For what? I didn't get you anything. - You stood up for our relationship. What relationship? Alan, we're not gay. No, but if we were, you wouldn't let anybody steal me away. And I think that's sweet. You need to stop this. I was just trying to get more money out of him, and that's all. Whatever you say. Pookie. Is the breadbasket the front or the back? - The back. - Oh, good. It wasn't just a line. Pick it up, Charlie. We're lagging. Gimme a break. I haven't even been to bed yet. Well, perhaps it's time for you to reexamine your club-hopping popper-sniffing, disco lifestyle. I explained about that. It doesn't matter, darling. You're here, you're queer. I'm used to it. 





                    			Can't we just go home? If I gotta drag you to the doctor at 8 in the morning you can cool your jets while I get coffee. I must look like an idiot. Wish I could tell you different. You're the reason we went to the eye doctor in the first place. You said, "Throw me a piece of toast." I threw you a piece of toast. Two cups of regular coffee, please. - My treat. - Oh, that makes up for everything. Pigeons can feed out of my eye socket, but I get a free cup of coffee. Just the coffee. Keep the change. I'm gonna need your help until I get this patch off. I am absolutely there for you. Great. Great. So So you'll drive me to work, pick me up, get Jake at school do the grocery shopping - Okay, I may have misspoken. Charlie, you have to. You know I can't drive. I don't see why not. - Oh, look who's here. - Who? A girl I used to go out with. Over there. Hey, Sherri. - Hey, Charlie, long time. - Yeah. Good to see you. - This is my brother, Alan. - Hi. - Hi. - What happened to your eye? Well, I wanted a piece of toast, and Bar fight. - Nice to meet you. - Well, nice meeting you too. - Good to see you, Charlie. - Good to see you too. - Wow, you went out with her? - Yep. Why would you stop? I don't remember. I probably got bored. Bored? How do you get bored with that? For every beautiful woman, there's at least one guy out there who's tired of pretending to listen to her in exchange for sex. Well, let me go on record as saying, I am not that guy. If I ever had a woman like that, I would cherish her. I would worship her. I would start a small country and put her face on a stamp so I could lick her head. - Why don't you go talk to her. - Yeah, right. Gorgeous women like that are not interested in pasty guys like me unless we're in line for the British throne. - So you give up without even trying? - Yep. That's my motto. Why waste time on 10s when you're already getting rejected by sixes? Alan, listen to me. You are a smart, sensitive, good-Iooking man with some milky discharge coming out of one eye but who amongst us is perfect? That's the other thing. Look at me. I'm a mess. So? Women like Sherri have big, hunky guys hitting on them all day long. A guy like you walks up, makes a move, you know what that says to her? Trick or treat? It says, "I'm confident in who I am." - You think? - I know. So, what if she's not interested. What's the worst that could happen? Actually, the worst that could happen is she points at me and laughs, causing every seventh grader in the cafeteria to turn and watch me slink back to the geek table with a growing wet spot on the front of my chinos. We ninth graders enjoyed it also. But you're not in junior high anymore, and you're not a You're not in junior high anymore. - It's time to let go of those fears. - I don't know. Oh, come on, Alan. For once in your life, don't settle. Go for what you really want. You know what? You're right. I'm gonna go talk to her. Hold on. Let's clean some of that discharge. You wanna say "I'm confident," not "I'm infectious." There. Go get her. Hey, you see that guy over there? Twenty bucks says he wets himself. - Hello. - Hi. - Alan? - I remember. Look, I needed to come clean about something. I wasn't actually in a bar fight. I took a piece of whole-wheat toast to the eye. I mean, it was cut diagonally and toasted well so it was essentially shrapnel. Did some real damage. I see. And why do you feel the need to tell me all this? Well, I guess I didn't want our relationship to start on a lie. Our relationship? - I'll go now. - No, no, wait. Sit down. Join me. Okay. - That's it. I'm out. - Oh, come on. No, no, no. No more. You got a date. Leave it alone. Not just a date. A date with Enough. - I'd think you'd be happy for me. - I am happy for you. You had the courage to walk over with your pus-filled eye and fall on your ass and still got a date with one of the most beautiful women I've ever met. - I'm not only happy for you, I'm proud. - Thank you. Now, I have to re-evaluate everything I thought I knew about men, women, relationships, God and the universe. But that's not your problem. Charlie, I am as surprised as you that she said yes. I don't think so. I was really intimidated, but as it turns out, she's just like a regular person except for, you know, being from the planet: Alan, never do that around me again. You know, actually, we have a lot in common. Okay. I'll bite. Well, we both went through tough divorces. - Sherri was married? - You didn't know that? - It never came up. - What did come up? Never mind. Scratch that. Where should I take her to dinner? Where did you go so I can take her somewhere else? Last thing you want is for her to start comparing you to me. Exactly. Wait. What do you mean? You want your relationship to stand on its own. - Right. - Well, that's what I meant. Okay. I thought you were trying to rub my nose in the fact that you dated her. Alan, I would never do that. Well, thank you. I don't have to. You think you could kill a guy with a piece of toast? No. Because if you did, you could eat the toast. The police would never find the weapon. It's the perfect crime. And part of a nutritious breakfast. Okay, guys, I guess I'll see you later. Where you going? - Out for dinner. - With who? Jake, look, I think I think you're old enough to know that your dad's not just a dad. He's also a man and that even though I'm not married to your mom I still enjoy the company of women which means that I will occasionally go out with one. But the important thing for you to understand is that I am not trying to replace your mother. In fact, no one can replace your mother. I bet you could kill a guy with a piece of bacon. All right, then. I'm glad we had this talk. I'm gonna go post my plan on the Internet. You know, there's moments around here that make me wish I had a son of my own. That wasn't one of them. Yeah, well. Anyway, I really appreciate you watching him tonight. No problem. - How you getting to the restaurant? - Sherri's picking me up. - Very convenient. - Why? Because she's been here before? Been here with you? Because you've had sex with her in every room in the house? No, because you can't drive. But it's interesting to see how your mind works. Alan, let me give you some advice. Alcohol impairs your ability to make good decisions. We don't want you to lose that ability. We want her to. Of course. Very good. What else? Well, women like Sherri already know they're beautiful and desirable. - You won't score points by telling her. - Okay. Don't be in a hurry to spill your guts. She doesn't need your life story before you get the salad. - Got it. As someone who knows your life story, I'd say she doesn't need to hear it at all. Right, right. I'll be cool, aloof, distant. She's here, she's here, she's here! What about the What What What about the kiss goodnight? - Should I ask or just go for it? - Go for it. Don't wait until the last minute. It creates pressure. - Get it out of the way early. - How early? After dinner, when you walk to the car open her door, wait for her to say thank you smile, lean in, and kiss her. Oh, nice. Hi, Alan. You ready? You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, and I don't deserve you. That's another way to go. - Madam. - Thank you. - Sir. - Oh, thank you. - Would you like the wine list? - No. I'll have the Woodbridge Pinot Noir. Or should we get a bottle? Oh, definitely get a bottle. Coffee for me. You know, Sherri, I'd really like to see more of you. Maybe we should wait and see how tonight goes. No, I mean, I've only got one good eye. Could we change places? Oh, sure. - Are you okay? - Oh, yes, yes. Fine. - This is a nice place. - Yeah. It's my favorite. You ever come here with Charlie? I don't know. Probably. He's a big steak-eater. I'm more of a fish guy. You know, I'm surf, he's turf. And we're cops. - You're very cute. - You too. All right. So tell me about yourself. Well, there's not a lot to tell. I was San Fernando Valley Chiropractor of the Year if you follow that kind of thing. Recently divorced. But not too recently. I've already had my rebound, transitional relationships. - So no worries there. - Good to know. Actually, it wasn't so much a relationship as a case of mistaken identity, but I think it still counts. - Okay. - And as you know, I live with Charlie whom you've already - Met? - Yeah, let's go with met. Alan, is my having dated Charlie gonna be a problem for you? No, no, no. A little. Okay, look. Charlie and l We had a very brief, superficial relationship. Okay? And to be honest, it was mostly about sex. Great. My point is, yeah, I'm tired of those, those shallow relationships I was having with guys like Charlie. I wanna be with a man who can be sensitive and caring, nurturing. You know, somebody who can make me laugh, make me think. You do realize I'm straight, right? - See, you really are adorable. - Thank you. I tend to bring out the mothering instinct in women. - Oh, really? - Ironically, not my mother. What the hell are you doing? Check it out. Ninja death toast. Okay, stop it, stop it. You're in no position to give orders, Mr. Harper. - Morning. - Morning. - Death toast? - Oh, thank you. - So how did it go last night? - Fine. That's it? Fine? Charlie, we're not in high school anymore. I'm not gonna go into detail. - Okay, don't tell me. - Jake, go watch TV. - I'm still hungry. - There's bread all over the living room. All right. - Well? - It went great. She said I'm adorable. She thinks I'm nurturing, caring and sensitive. - I'm exactly what she's looking for. - She's looking for a half-blind sheepdog? She invited me to her house for dinner tonight. - I think she wants to have sex. - With who? - With me. - With you. Hang on a second. Nope. No snowballs reported in hell. No sightings of flying pigs. - What am I gonna do? - You don't know? Come on, Alan, you were married for 12 years. What does marriage have to do with sex? Point taken. Okay, you want some tips? No, no, nothing like that. I need step-by-step instructions. All right. Since this is your first bout in this weight class I'd say stick with the basics. Better to do the simple stuff well than the fancy stuff badly. Got it. And the simple stuff would be Well, you know how women like you to go slow? Really? My ex-wife put a premium on brevity. Her motto was, " Less is more, and none is perfect." Well, Sherri's not like that. You're gonna wanna take your time. - I can do that. - But don't loiter either. You don't want her to get bored and play solitaire on your head. No loitering. Got it. - Something else? - Okay. When you're with a woman like Sherri, who's so gosh-darn beautiful that you get excited just thinking about her how do you keep the sprinklers from going off while you're still mowing? Let me make sure I understand. You wanna keep your toothpaste in the tube until you're done brushing. What are you talking about? - What are you talking about? - Okay, okay. Let me try again. I don't wanna frost the cake while I'm still mixing the batter. I don't get it. She must have lost a bet. - Excuse me? - Nothing. All right. Here's what you do. When you feel like the train is leaving the station You mean, going in the tunnel? No, no, I mean leaving the station. But you have to leave the station to get to the tunnel. Okay, okay. Let's start from the top. And work our way down, right? You know what? Just shut up and listen. When you're making love, the way to slow yourself down is to think of something completely non-sexual. - Well, what do you think of? - You. That was a really great dinner. I'm glad you enjoyed it. You ready for dessert? I've been ready since I was 14. I'll be back. Why don't you put some music on. Okay. Hey, how about Diana Krall? Oh, actually, that's your brother's CD. Do you mind bringing it back to him? Not at all. I think I have one of his T-shirts. You might as well take that too. No problem. Hey, this is a cool, little CD player. Oh, thanks. It was a gift from your It was a gift. Perfect. Is there anything else Charlie left behind? Just me. My brother's a fool. No argument here. - That is a very effective neglige. - Thank you. - Was it a gift? - No. - As a matter of fact, I bought it myself. - Oh, good. - How long ago? - What? Well, I was just wondering if Charlie saw it. Alan, don't go there. Oh, I wasn't going anywhere. It's just that - Nothing. More kissing. - Okay, okay. What exactly is bothering you? Well, it's kind of hard to explain. For example, once, when Charlie and I were at camp I lost my swim trunks, and I had to wear an old pair of Charlie's, and I just couldn't enjoy the pool at all. So, what are you saying? I'm a pair of used swim trunks? No, no. In this case, I think you would be the pool. Maybe this was a bad idea. No, no, it's a great idea. It's right up there with the wheel, fire and refrigerators that give ice through the door. - Sorry. I don't wanna do this anymore. - What? Why? You can't be with me without it being some competition with your brother. It's not a competition. And even it was, shouldn't we do it first before you decide who wins? You are unbelievable. - That could be taken a couple of ways. - Get out. Well, no ambiguity there. Don't forget your brother's CD. My eye! Man, I love sunsets. The way the sky is streaked with color. It's amazing. It's the pollution that makes those pretty colors, you know. What you're enjoying is the effect of light passing through airborne poison. No, that's not what I'm really enjoying. Boy, I hope that's guacamole. 





                    			- You got a date tonight? - No. Aren't you gonna ask me if I do? Okay. You got a date tonight? Sure, rub my nose in it. Besides, I'd rather hang out with you and Jake than engage in mindless conversation with some strange woman in the desperate hope that she might sleep with me. Me too. If we can't lie to each other, who can we lie to? To family. - Who is it? - It's Mom. Oh, odds. - Once, twice, three, shoot. - Once, twice, three, shoot. Hey, Mom. No, I don't have a date tonight. Don't you wanna know about Alan? So, what's up? Yes, I got your message. I was gonna call you back, but I was. I was. I was. Okay, I wasn't. I'm sorry. And do you wanna tell me why you called? I said, I'm sorry. I am sorry. I am. I am. All right, I'm not. So, what's up? Tomorrow? Yeah, sure. One of us will be here. I'll be here. All right, gotta go. Love you. No, I'm not just saying that. I'm not. No, I'm not. Mom, we both know where this going. - Sorry to stick you with her. - Yeah, sure. - I am. - Right. - I am. - Whatever. Okay, I'm not. Schmuck. For 30 years, every time I call odds, he throws a two, and I'm the schmuck. - Hey, buddy. - Hey, Dad. - Here's the bill for Jake's class trip. - Why give it to me? - So you can pay it. - Me? What's the point of giving child support if you don't support the child? Child support doesn't cover class trips. - Says who? - You wanna make an issue of this? Have your lawyer call mine. They can decide who pays for class trips. Oh, I'm sorry. Class trips? I'm happy to pay for class trips. I thought you said "ass clips." What are ass clips? I don't know, but I don't intend to pay for them. Goodbye, Alan. At least we settled who pays for ass clips around here. Okay, Mom. Good talking to you. I'm gonna hang up now. Yes, I am. I am. Okay, I'm not. - Jake's here. - Cool. It wouldn't kill you to talk to Mom once in a while. We don't know that. - Besides, you lost fair and square. - I don't think so. - I think you cheated. - At odds and evens? How on earth does one cheat at odds and evens? Don't give me that big, cow-eyed, aw-shucks, Howdy Doody veneer. - What? - You heard me. Yeah, I heard you and as long as we're stringing random words together shoebox, MoonPie, Band-Aid. Let me tell you something, Alan, and I say this with no agenda. I am not a judgmental person, but you, you are a horrible little man. You smile, tell everybody what they wanna hear but I know what goes on inside your grinning puppet head. You don't have a clue what's going on inside my puppet head because to know that, you would have to be capable of perceiving the world that exists beyond the tip of your penis. Don't talk about my penis. You have not earned the right. You are a selfish man, Charlie. You're a user. You just suckle from the teat of life and you never give back. "Suckle from the teat of life"? Who are you, Henry Wadsworth Pinhead? - You call me that because I'm right. - I call you that because you can wear a thimble as a hat. Hey, what's going on? - Nothing. - Just hanging out. Cool. You know, if you guys were queer we'd be what they'd call an alternated family. - Morning. - Morning. I feel bad about last night. That's okay. I forgive you. I didn't apologize. Well, then I guess I'm just a bigger man than you are. I'm kidding. Forget about it. Okay. - What do you wanna do with Jake? - I don't know. How about a barbecue? Well, I'm sure the kid's delicious, but I think I'd rather have hamburgers. Dad, check it out. Mom bought me new shoes. - Very cool. - Yeah, they were really expensive. - I'll bet. - She said to give you the bill. What? Why do I get the bill? So you can give me a check to pay her back. - Why? - She doesn't trust me with cash. No. Why should I be buying your shoes? You didn't. Mom did. This is so wrong. I send her a child support check every month which is supposed to include things like clothing, food, shoes. Alan, you're like an Alzheimer's victim in a whorehouse. Excuse me? You're constantly surprised that you've been screwed and you don't wanna pay for it. - Morning. - Morning. Did you drop off the dry cleaning by the back door? That was dry cleaning? I thought you were throwing that stuff out. You threw out my clothes? I gave them to my sister's husband, Earl. You gave three cashmere sweaters and a new sport coat to your brother-in-law? Why shouldn't he have nice things? He's paid his debt to society. You have to get them back. I wish I could, but Earl's got one withered arm and he had all the left sleeves hemmed. Those were expensive clothes, Berta. Wanna take it out in trade, stud? Because this back brace snaps off with the flick of a wrist. Okay, okay, that's the last straw. You have abused my good nature for too long, and I am putting my foot down. Well, you let me know how that works out for you. I guess we know who's in charge around here. If I want your opinion, I'll ask your ex-wife. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah? Well, if I want your opinion I'll ask one of the dozens of women you have meaningless casual sex with. Oh, ouch. - Hey, Uncle Charlie? - What? - I love you. - What did you do, Jake? I love you too, Dad. - What did he do? - How am I supposed to know? Well, he's your knuckleheaded son. He's my knuckleheaded son now, but when you're trawling for tail at The Home Depot, he's your slow but adorable nephew. I might as well get one perk out of having you sponge off me. - Sponge? Sponge? - Oh, that's a good idea. Well, let me tell you something. Take away your fancy house, your fancy car your women, and what have you got? A better-Iooking version of you. Have I mentioned how much I hate you? Have I mentioned how much I hate you? - Don't copy me. - Don't copy me. - You're an idiot. - You're an idiot. - I'm warning you, Charlie. - I'm warning you, Charlie. How childish. Would you mind toasting my buns, please? To your buns. You sicken me. Hey. - Hey, Rose. - What's going on? Just making lunch. - Wanna join us? - Maybe some other time. A little garlic butter is also a good way to jazz up a hamburger bun. He's lucky all I'm doing is spitting. It doesn't take a master's in behavioral psychology, which I happen to have to see that you and you brother have unresolved fraternal conflicts. Gee, you think? I think it might be therapeutic for you two to sit down with someone and explore those conflicts. - You mean you? - Well, I could refer you to the woman I talk to, but she doesn't exist. So, yeah. Me. Let's see. Couples counseling for me and Alan with you as the therapist. Why don't we just drop acid, run out into the ocean and pretend we're dolphins? You're exhibiting a lot of hostility, Charlie. You know what we psychologists call that? - What? - Hostility. Why would we need more than one word for it? Rose, I appreciate your concern, but Alan and I don't need therapy. Everything will work itself out. I'm just saying, I think it would really help you guys if you could sit down and share your feelings. We're fine, Rose. - Choke on it, princess. - Bite me, bitch. I think he may have anticipated that. - How Freudian. - It's not Freudian. But mine's bigger. It's a banana, you moron. It's not just about you and Charlie, you know. There's that innocent little moppet to consider. Moppet? I'm baking air biscuits. Get them while they're hot. He may not be able to process it now but he picks up on all the negative emotion around here. Save yourselves, run for your lives! Okay, well, if you can get Charlie to agree, I'll do it. - Good. - And as a rule when says they're bad, take his word for it. Oh, please, Alan. I grew up with two older brothers and Oh, my God! The only reason I let him live here is because of Jake. Go on. He was a pain in the ass when we were kids and now he's blossomed into a three-fingered prostate exam. Have you considered the possibility that since you're the older brother you harbor resentment towards him for usurping Mommy's love and attention? I'm sorry, have you met my mother? Okay, so that's a no. Please don't try to psychoanalyze me. Oh, Charlie. Psychoanalysis takes years. I'm just messing around inside your head. Have you ever considered the possibility that you are the primary male role model in Alan's life? And if his behavior is making you mad, he learned it from you. So, in fact, you are making you mad. That's nuts. Just sit with it for a moment. I think it's a pretty good insight. No, I'm gonna stick with nuts. And I don't wanna continue this. Do you feel you can't be totally honest with me since we slept together? - No. Why can't you be totally honest? - I can be totally honest with you. - Really? How much did you like having sex with me? Let's go talk to Alan. And they wouldn't give me a license. All right. Let the healing begin, you pinhead. Can we refrain from counterproductive name-calling? Such big words from such a little head. Charlie, please sit down. Okay. Here are the ground rules. There will be no name-calling and no interrupting. The purpose of this is to air our feelings without judgment. - Alan, why don't you start? - Why does he start? - Would you like to start? - No. Then shut up. Alan, you'll go first. And begin with the phrase, "I feel Charlie is 'blank.'" I don't think I can top that. Okay, I feel like Charlie is ashamed to have me as a brother. Well, there you go. Are we done? Charlie, you'll get your turn. When was the first time you felt that way, Alan? I guess on the playground. The first day of kindergarten, he told his friends that I was a shaved monkey our mom won in a poker game. Charlie, why do you think you might have said something like that? Well, I guess deep down I always wanted a shaved monkey. You promised Mom you would look after me. I was 7 years old. You can't trust a 7-year-old. You know how he looks after me? He gave me wedgies. From kindergarten on, I got daily wedgies. My butt cheeks didn't unclench until my second year of college. At which point, a long stick slid out. Let's try a little role-playing. He put dog poop in my Mork and Mindy lunchbox. Oh, will you please let that go? And by the way, if you think it through we didn't have a dog. - What? Mom told me to make you lunch, I made you lunch. Oh, my God! Do you see what I have been dealing with my entire life? The real genius was putting it in a hot-dog bun. All through the second grade he would introduce me as his ugly sister, Alana? That's because all through second grade, you wore culottes. They were extra roomy Bermuda shorts. I was prone to chafing. Charlie, how did you feel when you were calling Alan a monkey or a girl or putting excrement in his lunchbox? It's hard to describe. It was kind of a warm, satisfied feeling. And why do you think you felt that way? Because he was such a smartass. Straight A's, Mommy's favorite, Daddy's boy, stepdaddy's boy. Somebody had to take him down a peg. - You were jealous of me. - No, no. - I was annoyed. - I don't believe it. - You were jealous. - No, I wasn't. - Sounds like you were, Charlie. - You can't take sides. - That's unprofessional. - Professional? I'm just making this up as I go along. I'm drawing kitty-cats here. All these years, you had to put me down because you secretly believed that I was better than you. No, that's ridiculous. I knew I was better, but I didn't think you knew. No, no, I didn't know that. There was nothing to know. I don't buy it. You were an emotionally wounded child. I wasn't wounded. I was the wounder. He was the woundee. I was a mean, rotten brother. You've gotta believe me. I tortured him. Once, I convinced him the clothes dryer was a time machine. When he got out, I was dressed in Pilgrim clothes and threatened to burn him as a witch. And now I understand why you did all those things. - And I forgive you. - Don't forgive me. Hate me. Fear me. - Come here. - No. - Come on. Give me a hug. - No, forget it. - Would you rather hug me? - What would be the point of that? It gets me hot. All right, if it'll put an end to all this, one hug. Hey, what are you doing? Let's see how you like a wedgie. Where's your underwear? I'm not wearing any, but thanks for scratching my ass. - This turned out to be a nice weekend. - Yeah. Go figure. Who would've thought Rose would be right? Certainly not Rose. She was right. We had a lot of baggage to clear up. - Yeah, and I'm glad we talked it out. - Me too. You know, when all is said and done, all we have in this world is each other. You, me and that methane cloud you call a son. - It's Mom. - Odds. That's okay. I got this one. - Thank you. - Hey, Mom. Oh, that's Judith. No, I'm just sitting here, enjoying the sunset with my favorite brother. Alan. I'm not lying. I'm not. I'm not. Okay, I am. Jake, your mom's here. - Hey, Judith, how's it going? - I just had a flat tire on the freeway and called AAA, only to find out I no longer have AAA because you no longer pay my dues. - Excuse me, but we're divorced. - You pay that out of your alimony. - No. Because you didn't, I had to stand on the side of the road until a creepy man stopped and offered to change my tire if I'd show him my breasts. Well, there you go. I paid for your breasts. Okay, fine. We'll let our attorneys figure out who pays for roadside service. - No attorneys. - I'm happy to pay for it. - Thank you. - Was that so hard? - No. No, not hard at all. - Bye, Dad. - Bye, buddy. In fact, it was easy. All I had to do was bend over and unclench. Okay, I said it. Mom, you just said I said it. - Have fun at school. - All right. Charlie, wait up. - Did you make Alan's lunch? - Yep. Hey, wait. You forgot to kiss me goodbye. - No, I didn't. - Yes, you did. - I didn't. - Yes, you did. - Okay, I did. - Charlie, wait up. 





                    			Jake, use your spoon. Can't. I'll die. If you don't turn off that music, you'll die anyway. Fine. That's better. He's still gonna be living here when he's, like, 30. My big fear is he'll still be in fifth grade. Hello, anybody home? Grandmommy's here. There's my grandson. So, Mom, to what do we owe this unexpected - Pleasure? - No, that's not it. I was showing a house, and I thought I'd visit the people I love. And they weren't home? Goody. There's a Tudor on Stone Canyon that's going on the market soon. - How do you know? - Owner dropped dead of a heart attack. You know what they say, darling. Today's obituary is tomorrow's exclusive listing. Father of five in Westwood. I'm on fire. You will be soon. Mom, you're not setting a very good example here. Why? Jake, honey, your grandmommy performs a very important public service. When people die, their families are very, very sad and they have no idea what their homes are worth. And you tell them? Oh, you are so cute. And Grandmommy doesn't just prey on the dead, Jake. She also profits from the pain of divorce and the humiliation of bankruptcy. Not to mention she's working on an alternative fuel made from puppies. Oh, my God. Harry Gorsky died. Oh, no. Are you sure it's him? How many Harry Luther Gorskys are there in Los Angeles? - Well, there's one less now. - Who are you talking about? He was Uncle Charlie's and my stepdad. - The first of three, and not my favorite. - I liked him. Oh, please. You were 6. You still liked Mom. - Mom, are you okay? - No, I'm not okay. He was a good man and part of my life, and now he's gone. I just pray he died peacefully and held on to that stately six-bedroom, four-bath Colonial in Hancock Park with the bonus office/guest room over the garage. Let me get this straight. First there was your dad, then this guy Harry who died then the fat guy with the carpet business. No, no, no. The fat guy came after the twitchy gay guy from Texas who gave us crew cuts and called us buckaroos. So out of the three Harry was the best. - I liked the fat guy, remember? With the chubby daughter who was so grateful? All you had to do was knock on her door with some Turkish Taffy. Be that as it may, he was still a very good father to us. Oh, please. He was a little tyrant. "Sit up straight." "Do your homework." "Quit forging my signature on hotel bills." Okay, then. The funeral is tomorrow. I think it would be appropriate for us all to go and pay our respects. I don't know. Tomorrow's not good for me. Oh, Charlie. The man was your father. No, he was not. Why do you care so much? You divorced him. Just because you divorce doesn't mean you no longer have feelings. That's true. Judith still has feelings for me. Pity is not really a feeling, Alan. Regardless of our feelings, we'll still go and say our final goodbyes to Harry. - I'm not going. - Me neither. - Fine, you stay here with Uncle Charlie. - Cool. Yeah, cool. Why do you wanna go? I think it's the right thing to do, and I liked Harry. - And he liked you. - I know. We've stayed in touch over the years. What? You betrayed me by communicating with that son of a bitch after I divorced him? Well, wait a minute. You said that I know what I said. I was just being polite because the guy's worm chow. All I did was send him Christmas cards and a picture of Jake. - You never send me a picture of Jake. - He's right here. When was the last time I got a Christmas card? Wait, I'm on your side. Charlie's the one who doesn't wanna go. I don't even know if I want you to come now. You've ruined it. - How can you ruin a funeral? - I don't wanna talk about it anymore. - Where are you going? - I need something black. Doesn't your soul qualify? Laugh now, but when I die, I will be coming back to haunt you. How will that be any different than this? Okay, Jake. I'm going to pick up your grandmother. Okay. You think maybe you've played that enough? Okay. I might as well just buy him a crack pipe. Hey! - Let's get this over with. - You're coming to the funeral? I thought about it and realized, even if I didn't like the guy that shouldn't stop me from going to his funeral and, you know, taking a victory lap. Charlie, you're not gonna wanna hear this but you sound a lot like Mom. Tread lightly. - Jake, you're coming with us. - I don't wanna. You get to see a real dead guy. There's gonna be a dead guy? Where? - At the funeral. - Oh, cool. Can I come? Did I say he was gonna live here until 30? I meant forever. What are you talking about? - Go put on your nice clothes. - Okay. He doesn't know what nice clothes are. - Jake? - Oh, right. Isn't it a little early to start drinking? - Would you like a snort? - That's what I meant. Thanks. You okay, Mom? I just can't believe he's gone. Isn't that why we're going to the funeral? To make sure? I'm confused. If you cared for Harry so much, how come you left him? Yes, well, about that. I may have glossed over the details with you boys just a skosh. I didn't actually leave Harry so much as he left me. - You're kidding. - He met a younger woman and just traded me in. You still loved him, didn't you? I loved him very much. Oh, Harry. My sweet, dear Harry. All right. Level eight. So where's the dead guy? Jake, show a little respect. Where's the dead guy, sir? In the chapel. Now keep it down. I think I can smell him. Oh, Lord. There she is. - Who? - The tramp who stole my husband. Not bad. Not good. I'm gonna go mourn. - Yeah, me too. - Stay put. Mommy needs you. - Hello, Evelyn. - Hello, Christine. - This is my son, Alan. - Hello. And who's this little guy? Your grandson? I'm just here to see the dead guy. Yes, I've been blessed with both children and grandchildren. How about you? Oh, wait, I remember. You were slightly less fertile than a sand trap. We're very sorry for your loss. It's not my loss. He left me for that tramp over there. She doesn't look very unhappy, does she? She just met him. Wait a week. I think it's the responsibility of we, the living, to carry on to live life to the fullest. Embrace it. Kiss it on the mouth, if you will. Excuse me, Charlie, can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. Heather, this is my brother, Alan. He lives with me at my beach house in Malibu. - Hi. - I'm sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - Alan came to live with me at my Malibu beach house when he lost his wife. It's a healing house. My wife isn't really dead. Because you healed. At my Malibu beach house. And when you think about it, Harry isn't really dead either. He lives right here in all of us. - Thank you. - Good. Let go. It's good to let go. Charlie. Excuse me a moment. What, what, what, what, what? What do you mean, "What, what, what"? - You're hitting on the widow. - No, I'm consoling the widow. I won't hit on her until they close the lid. Unbelievable. How do you sleep at night? Usually drunk and on top of somebody. But that takes work, Alan. Doesn't just happen by itself. Here's an idea. Why don't you run to the embalming room and see if you can score a couple fresh ones off the truck? Excuse me, but considering your ex-wife I'd say you're the expert on having sex with cold women who don't move. Nevertheless, you can hit on women anywhere. Why did you bother to come? I don't know. I just did. - That's it? No reason? - Do you have a reason for everything? - Yes. - So how's that working out for you? I know how difficult it must be rambling around all by yourself in that big, drafty, six-bedroom Colonial with the guest room/office over the garage. Harry gave me a potbellied pig. So you'd remember him, sure. But I know Harry would want you to move on and this is the perfect time to move on because this is a seller's market. - Excuse me. Can we talk to you a minute? Pardon me, dear. What? I'm working here. That woman just lost her husband. Alan, the man was 50 years old when she was born. - So? - So she had to see it coming. Even for you, that is really cold. Oh, Mr. Graveside Nookie weighs in. You were trying to give the widow a sympathetic crotch to cry on. Hey, watch your mouth. This is a solemn event. Yeah, show a little class. Me? I'm the only one here behaving appropriately. Hey, where's Jake? - Jake. - How do you know my name? - It's okay. - Okay? I almost pooped my pants. What are you doing? I just wanted to see. Okay, well, let's Let's take a look. - Really? - Yeah. Come on. - What do you think? - I don't know. - How did he die? - He just got old. His heart stopped. His watch is still going. - Yep. - Why would he need a watch, anyway? It's not like he's gonna be late for anything. Okay, there are other people waiting to pay their respects. Why don't we go find Grandma? I don't care what anybody says. I always thought you were a good guy. Thanks, Alan. Want to know what time it is? Let's go. - How's he look? - Dead. Cool. Surprise. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I've been thinking about it and maybe some of the stuff between us may have been my fault. I was angry about losing my dad, and I guess you were the guy I took it out on. Anyway, not that it makes a lot of difference at this point but I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry. By the way, I'm gonna take a shot at your wife. But that's just a guy thing. Nothing personal, okay? I'll take that as a yes. And so with every door that God closes, he opens a window. Did he say "window" or "widow"? Even as we say goodbye to our beloved friend Harry Luther Gorsky we know that he lives on in all of us. - How are you holding up? - Okay. - Lf you need anything, I'm right here. - Thank you. That's very comforting. For everything, there is a season. A time to be born, a time to die. A time to reap, a time to sow. So I would like to invite anyone who wishes to say a few words about Harry to come up and share with us. As always, I'll do him first. - Mom, bad idea. - Hey if I didn't give in to bad ideas, you wouldn't be here. Hold this. Dad. I can't find my Gameboy. Not now, Jake. Hello. Welcome to Harry's funeral. I haven't seen him so drained of bodily fluids since our honeymoon. What? I thought I'd open with a joke. My name is Evelyn Harper or, as dear Harry used to call me, his sweet little sugar tushy. When I first met Harry I was just a hot young widow with bills to pay who could lick the chrome off a trailer hitch. I also had two small boys one of whom Harry cared for very deeply. The other one was Charlie. It wasn't easy being a substitute father but Harry gave it his all. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough which is probably why he looked for solace in the arms of a cheap slut. Stand up, Christine. Let everybody have a look at you. Take a good look, Heather. That's gonna be you someday. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being disrespectful to the grieving widow. But, listen, you wanna talk grieving? I'm grieving. I loved this man with all my heart, and you left me, you lousy bastard. Well, take a good look. I've still got a great ass and yours is decomposing as we speak. Thank you. - Okay. That was beautiful. - Time to go. I'll call you. - Dad, what about my Gameboy? - Forget it. Just keep walking. And so let's take a moment of silent prayer for our friend, Harry. I am really, really sorry. Got it. It's my kid's. I don't know, maybe I spoil him. Okay, bye. Boys, when I die I want a simple funeral. No tears. - Done. - You got it. And I wanna be buried next to your father. Dad was cremated, Mom. Oh, yes, right. I was thinking of someone else. So I take it you'd rather be buried than cremated? Oh, can't we do both? I want to be buried on the side of a hill nestled amongst the willows, overlooking the ocean. Do we get to pick the ocean? And I want an unadorned headstone, which reads simply: "Evelyn Harper. Loving wife, devoted mother." That's good. Open with a joke. 





                    			Charlie? Where's Charlie? Check the living room. - Charlie, guess what? - Somebody call me? Not me. He's not in the living room. - Try his bedroom. - Thanks. Charlie, you gotta see this. Are you sure nobody's calling me? Wouldn't I tell you? Berta, he's not in his room. - What? - I said, he's not in his room. What? - Did you find him? - He's not up there. - Try Jake's room. - What'd he be doing in Jake's room? Hey, I'm just trying to help. I'm sorry. Charlie! I'm sure I heard something. I don't know what to tell you. I could do this all day. Charlie. Hey, Alan. - Didn't you hear me calling you? - Oh, that was you. Of course it was me. Who else would it be? Don't snap at me. I've been running all over looking for you. Well, I was right here. I know that now. Hey, that's no reason to have a hissy fit. Hissy fit? This is not a hissy fit. Say it higher, Alan. A couple of dogs in the neighborhood didn't hear you. I'm all done. I'm going home now. - Thank you. - Good night. Good night, my pets. Now that you've managed to find me, what do you want? There was something I was excited to show you, but now I don't want to. - I'm okay with that. - So am I. Oh, come on. You gotta see this. All right. Fine. Hey. Wait a minute. Did Berta know you were out here? Very mature, Alan. Blame the maid. Oh, you bought a Porsche. "Porsche." What do you think? It's cute. What do you mean, cute? I mean, it looks like my car's hot little girlfriend. Are you saying this is a chick car? Because it isn't. It's a Porsche. Yeah. The cute little one. No, no, no. It's the sporty one. If your sport is girls' basketball. No, no, it's got the fuel injection, and the rack and the pinion and the leather thingy to cover the hood. That's called a bra, Alan. Yeah, but it's made of leather. - All right. Whatever. - It is not a chick car. The salesman showed me brochures with pictures of guys driving it. Alan, if a monkey walked into the dealership he'd have been shown pictures of monkeys driving it. Monkeys can't drive a stick. Now, come on. We'll go for a spin, pick up Jake. Where'd you get the money for this? Where'd you get it because they're not cheap. - No, no, they are not. Where'd you get the money for this? The money. Where'd you get it? Oh, I got it from - What? - I got a loan from Alan, where'd the money come from? I found it. - Alan? - Mom. You traded your soul for a Porsche. I didn't trade my soul, and it's "Porsche." Alan, why didn't you come to me? No, I already owe you so much. You won't let me pay rent and you pay all the utilities. Keeping that in mind, did you ever consider taking the money from Mom and paying me back? No, not really. Come on. Let me show you what this baby can do. Well, what do you know? Monkeys can drive a stick. You know, the salesman was right. You really do feel special in one of these things. Oh, yeah. Probably not a lot of middle-aged, divorced guys driving around L.A. In a Porsche. "Porsche." Oh, wait, I forgot to show you the best part. Alan, that's a NASCAR hat. Yeah, they were out of the Porsche hats. I wanted something that said speed and performance, so I got this. What you should be wearing is a hat with a propeller on top. Come on, open her up. The first 1000 miles is the break-in period. You're not supposed to go over 65. Well, then go 65. The speed limit is 60. You want me to get a ticket? Alan, you're driving an expensive red sports car. If you're not getting tickets and tail, you might as well take the bus. Which, by the way, just passed us. I am going plenty fast, thank you very much. Can we at least put the top down? No, I wanna trap the new-car smell in as long as I can. Man, are you anal-retentive. You need a bumper sticker that reads, "My other car is a puckered rectum." Oh, yeah. Like I'd desecrate this car with a bumper sticker. God, I love that sound. Will you stop it? Jake, your dad's here. Where's your car? Oh, my car? My car is right there. - You got a Porsche? - "Porsche." I have to struggle to make ends meet, and you can buy a Porsche? What are you talking about? Your ends have not only met they've been to Hawaii and remodeled the kitchen. Don't change the subject. How can you afford a fancy car? Well, I can't afford it, really. Maybe I have to call my attorney. And re-examine our whole alimony/child-support agreement. No, no, you don't. It wasn't very expensive. This is the girl version. Right, Charlie? Oh, yeah, yeah. You've gotta kiss it before you can even stick the key in. Judith, you have nothing to worry about. You've successfully sucked me dry. Absolutely. This guy's farting dust. Then where'd he get the money for the car? He borrowed it from our mother. Give me a break. Even Alan's not that stupid. Oh, but he is. I am. I swear to God. - Hey, cool car. Is it yours? - Yeah. We're gonna have to talk about my allowance. Okay, well, have a nice weekend. Wait a minute. That's a two-seater. Where's he gonna sit? And you didn't believe he was that stupid. We're going way over the speed limit. Let me worry about that. You just keep looking for cops. I don't usually take a cab. I drive a red Boxster. You know, Porsche. - Those are very nice. - Thank you. My sister has one. - Hey, Berta. You seen my brother? - Did you check his room? Thanks. Sweetie, it is a beautiful car. Congratulations. - Thanks, Mom. I'm really enjoying it. - Well, your Aunt Sylvia loves hers. Berta, have you seen Charlie? Look out on the deck. - I was looking for you. - I was in the garage. - I was looking for you. - I was looking for Alan. I was in the garage. Okay. Bye. Oh, sure. Blame the maid. Oh, Alan, before I forget, I need to ask you for a little favor. Your soul, please. Charlie, for God's sake Careful. I don't think you're allowed to say "God" without bursting into flames or something. Shush with your antichrist humor. It's getting old. Alan, I'd like you to join me for dinner tomorrow night. - Why? - I'm dating a man I'd like you to meet. And? He has a lovely daughter about your age. Sayeth the serpent. No. Mom, please, please, please, no blind dates. Why not? She's a sweet girl and I think you might really hit it off. - Why can't Charlie go out with her? - Hey, she didn't buy me a car. This has absolutely nothing to do with the car. Besides, I want to get closer to this man. Should the time come when I want an ugly breakup I'll let you take a crack at his daughter. I'm sorry, Mom. But I'd rather not. Alan, I bought you a car. I love the smell of brimstone in the morning. Tomorrow night, 8:00, Le Pissoir. - I really appreciate this, darling. - Sure. Oh, one more thing. She's been through a rough patch lately so we won't be ordering alcohol. Bye-bye. No, really. She sounds great. Looks like my mom and your dad are running a little late. Typical. Yeah. So you're in town for the weekend. Where do you live? Palm Springs. That's nice. How long have you lived there? Forty-two days, so far. Forty-two days? Yeah. This is my first weekend pass. I was supposed to get one at 30, but I bit a guy. - Would you like a cocktail? - No, no, no cocktails. No. - No, that's all right. You can have one. - No, I'm fine. - Oh, please. Go ahead. - No. I don't think Order a drink, damn it. I wanna smell it. We're fine. Maybe just a fizzy water. So, what do you do? I'm a chiropractor. Really? Can you prescribe stuff? No. Did you hear that? - It's my phone. - Oh, thank God. Hello? Oh, hey, Mom. Where are you? Yes, she's here. Yes, very sweet. Where are you? Trudy, Trudy, there's no smoking. Oh, that's just great. Just jim-freaking-dandy. You guys are coming, right? Well, what am I supposed to do? Yes, I know you bought me a car. All right, all right. All right. Goodbye. Apparently, your father mixed up his heart pills with his Viagra and they didn't wanna waste the opportunity. So he's not coming? Well Perfect. Just perfect. That son of a bitch never cared about me. Trudy, Trudy He'd rather spend the night with some old hose bag. That old hose bag is my mother and there's still no smoking in here. I'm sorry. Careful. I bit the last guy who tried to touch me. Yeah, well, that doesn't mean we can't have a nice meal. I'll call the waiter. Hello, hello. Yeah, we're ready to order. Remind me to get some clean urine from you before we go. - Two hundred forty pounds - What are you doing? Picking off the pepperonis. Then why'd you order it with pepperonis? I like to stack them up and eat them in bed. Hello? Hey, Mom. No, Dad's not here. He's on a date. Hang on. Uncle Charlie's talking to me. Yeah? Don't tell your mom your father's on a date. - It's none of her business. - Okay. He's not on a date. Hang on. She wants to talk to you. Uncle Charlie's not here. Give me that. Hey, Judith. What's up? Well, he's not a bright kid. What do you want from me? I don't know where Alan is. Would you like me to give him a message? Because who knows? Maybe this time I will. No message. How come it's a secret Dad's on a date? It's not. It's just never a good idea to tell women more than they need to know. How come? Because we love them and want to protect them. A clueless woman is a happy woman. - Can I have your pepperonis? - No. Batman! Come on. Come on, Trudy. Come on. Come on. - Let's get you back to the Batcave - Oh, right. or whatever cave you crawled out of. Thank you, kind sir. You are indeed a gentleman. Allow me to reward you. A salty! I shall now need a slice of lime and a carafe of tequila. No, thank you. No, no, we're fine. Hey, come on, Trudy. Let's take you home. Okay. But we'll have to be really quiet because my roommate is detoxing, so she's kind of a light sleeper. No, no, I meant home to your father. Oh, God. Daddy! Oh, I'm such a disappointment to you. Hey, your aftershave has alcohol in it. So why is Dad's car a chick car? It's not really. I was just saying that to bust his chops. Chops are your nuts, right? Right. Mom said it's a midlife-crisis car. Well, she was bound to be right about something eventually. What's a midlife crisis? Well, Jake, it's when a man starts facing his own mortality and tries to recapture his youth. I've had one of those. Do tell. Life was so much simpler when I was 6. Hello? Hey, Dad. Listen, don't worry about your midlife crisis. They usually go away over summer vacation. He wants to talk to you. Are you here? Yeah. Whoa, slow down. Well, how drunk is she? Really? Batman drunk? Well, just dump her with Mom and her father. Where are they? Viagra and a bad ticker. Mom loses more boyfriends that way. Alan, calm down, calm down. Listen to me. Here's what you do: Take her to a club pin a warning note on her back as a courtesy to the next guy and run like hell. Well, if you don't want my advice, why'd you call me? Okay, how about this: Put the top down and let the night air sober her up. What's plan B? How come you don't have a date tonight? I decided I'd rather hang out with you. - Really? - No. You're saying that to bust my chops. No. - Hey. - Hey. - How was your date? - Oh, lots of fun. - Think you'll marry her? - Doubtful. Charlie? What happened? You take her to a club and ditch her? - No, I couldn't do that. - Why not? Well, it's cheesy and immoral and I'm really not comfortable having some valet touch my car. - So where is she? - In the garage. - Oh, Alan. - Well, she passed out. - I figured I'd let her sleep it off. - You left her in your car? Why not? Well, at least she left the garage door open. It's a red Porsche Boxster with dealer plates. "Porsche." Yeah, about an hour ago. Hey, Dad, check it out. Your car's on TV. I'll call you back. - chase so far. The suspect was first spotted in Malibu  on the Pacific Coast Highway  and is now southbound on the 405 freeway. Oh, God! Don't worry. I've watched hundreds of these. They never make it. - she just ran over the nail strips that the Highway Patrol laid out. Oh, man, look at the sparks. That's because she's riding on rims, Jake. You gotta like how your car handles without tires. Oh, God! Whoa, that was a close call. She sideswiped that SUV and kept right on going. What's that dragging alongside Dad's car? I think that's the door. - Cool. - Oh, God! Dale, this is Trish in the studio. Can you see the suspect? How do you know it's a woman? Well, Trish, we actually don 't know it's a woman  but thought it was a safe bet based on the type of car. It's not a chick car. Relax, Dad. He's just busting your chops. 





                    			Hey, Jake, why don't you tell Grandma about your spring break. - Bad idea. - What? Nothing. I just saw that they're moving the L.A. Gardening Exposition to the Convention Center, which I think is a very bad idea. Thanks for the update. Go ahead, Jake, tell Grandma. - It was really cool, l - Hang on a second, Jake. I'm not sure you understand how serious this gardening thing is. It's a really bad idea. I get it. Bad idea. Go ahead, Jake. I went camping with Grandma and Grandpa. We slept in a tent, we cooked on an open fire. And we went hiking and saw a bear. You let him spend an entire vacation with his other grandparents and I haven't had him for a night? Oh, bad idea. This is unfair and unacceptable. From the moment that boy was born Judith's parents squeezed me out. And you let them. Interesting point. Excuse me, Mom, but when Jake was born Judith's mother stayed with us, cooking and cleaning and taking care of him. - Valid counterpoint. Exactly. She's a pushy, pushy woman. Personal opinion. No, no. You went on a cruise. But Judith was two days late. And I had nonrefundable reservations. Like it would have killed her to get a C-section. Self-obsessed psychotic rant. - Mom, are you listening to yourself? - Stupid question. Awkward silence. You wanna spend more time with your grandson, he's right here. No. He goes to visit his other grandparents. He should come to visit me. - So you wanna spend a week with him? - A week? Alan, I do have a life. I'm confused. What exactly do you want? The same quality time Jake spends with his other grandparents. But, you know, less. I'll tell you what. Bring him to my place around 6-ish tonight. I'll make him dinner, we'll have a fun sleepover. - Gee, Mom, I don't know. - Well, why not? Are you afraid one night with me will irreparably damage him? - Yeah. - A little. Excuse me. I didn't hear any complaints when I was raising you two. The teenage drinking and constant running away wasn't a slight tip-off? Oh, you were just a little drama queen, Charlie. And let's not forget, you always came back. Kind of hard to find steady work when you're 9. Whatever. My place, 6-ish. Judith! I can't just leave him with you without discussing it with his mother. Are you telling me you need to get your ex-wife's approval to let your own son spend time with your own mother? He had a really bad lawyer. You know what your problem is, Alan. You let women walk all over you. You get that from your father. Well, nevertheless, I still have to clear it with Judith. - Well, fine, call her. - Right now? Well, why not? Unless you'd rather I make the call. Probably not home. I'll just I'll leave a message. Yeah. Hi, Judith. Listen, it's Alan. Call me back when you get a chance. Hello? Oh, hi, Judith, you old call-screener, you. Listen, I just wanted to run something past you. Jake was telling my mom about the fun time he had with your parents and she thought that What do you mean, "no"? I haven't even asked yet. Oh, really? Well, I've got news for you, lady. You can't say no, she's his grandmother. Well, she may be that too but she's still his grandmother and this is my weekend with him. Charlie and I turned out fine. We did too. Look, he's going, and that's that. All right then, goodbye. - It's settled. He'll be there at 6. - Thank you. Of course, it is rather short notice. - Mom! - Okay. Fine. But don't get used to this. I'm not your full-time babysitter. I played that wrong, didn't I? No, no. You called mom's bluff and you stood up to your ex-wife. You maintained your self-respect, I'm proud of you. - Yeah, but what about Jake? - Oh, Jake. Jake's screwed. This has been the greatest day of my life. Movies, laser tag, video arcade. Well, that's good. I wanted today to be special. - How come? - Just because I love you. I love you too, Dad. You know how people say you can't buy love? I think they're wrong. You hold on to that sentiment. What's the plan for tonight? Is it gonna be special too? Oh, God, I can't watch this. - What? - Nothing. Oh, hey, here's $20. Wow, thanks. - You're spending tonight at Grandma's. - Great. Wait, what? You're gonna have lots of fun. - Right, Charlie? - This is the first I'm hearing of it. I don't want to go to Grandma's. Here, take your money. Come on, buddy. She loves you very much. And it's just for one night. But we were having so much fun. Think it through, Jake. Why were you having so much fun? - You tricked me. - Attaboy. What did I ever do to you? It's not a punishment. It's not a prize. - I'm calling Mom. - No. No, no calling Mom. I know my rights. I get one phone call. - I've already told your mother. - She agreed? She knows about it. Uncle Charlie, can you get me out of this? It depends. Are you willing to live in Mexico for a few years? Jake, please. Do it as a favor to your grandmother, who loves you. For me. For Uncle Charlie. But most of all, for me. What do I get? What do you mean? I spent a fortune on you today. That was because you love me. Now you need me. Oh, God, this is a great kid. Okay. What do you want? A motorized Razor scooter, the new Dragon Ball Z game an iPod mini and not to go to Grandma's. - I'll give you three out of four. - Okay. Forget the iPod. - This is the worst day of my life. - Come on. You're gonna eat your dinner, watch some videos, play some games and you're gonna go to bed and we'll pick you up tomorrow. Promise. Your word means nothing to me. Hey, give your dad a break. So he lied. You don't get the virgin to the volcano by telling her you're gonna push her in. - Can't we just go home? - No. Now, enough of this. - I am the adult and you are the child. - And this is the volcano. Now, you're gonna go in there and you're gonna have a nice evening. - Do we understand each other? - Yes. Thank you. Now, ring the bell. So exactly what time are you? Hey! We've done a terrible thing. Yeah. If only there was a magical liquid that could erase bad memories. I am absolutely racked with guilt. Alan, don't beat yourself up. You're a good dad who, in a moment of weakness, betrayed his only son. Come on, he's not in any real danger. Not physically, but you know as well I do that Mom has the ability to say things that stick with you. Yeah, forever and ever. My favorite was, " They must have mixed you up with another baby because I could never have given birth to such a hateful child." Who writes that on a fifth-grader's birthday card? How about, " It's no wonder your father stays at work. If I could get out of here, I would too." Did I ever tell you about the time I wrote my first jingle? Pepsi. I invited Mom over to watch the prime-time network debut. For 30 seconds, 20 million people were listening to my music. And at the end, Mom turned to me and said: "You couldn't get Coke to hire you?" - Nice. But I can top it. - Go. It's the day of my wedding. She's sitting there crying. And I think it's because she's happy. Turns out it was because she was, and I quote: "So relieved you finally found someone who could love you." - We gotta go get Jake. - You're right. Come on. Great game, ladies. - He'll be fine. - Who? - Jake. - Oh, yeah. He'll be fine. - Who? - Jake. He'll be fine. I thought we'd eat Japanese-style. Good Lord, are you picking your nose? I had to. There was stuff in it. And where were you planning to put it? I really didn't have a plan. Don't you dare wipe that on my furniture. And not on your clothes either. - What are you doing now? - Putting it back. Here, just wipe your hands. - Why? - Because we're going to eat dinner. And you've been rooting around in your nostril. It's okay. I don't eat with my hands. I use a fork. - Wipe your hands. - Okay. Thank you. Has your mother or father ever taken you out for sushi? No. I don't like raw fish. - Well, have you ever had it? - No. How do you know you don't like it? It's an educated guess. Well, why don't you just try it. Let's start with the tuna, shall we? There you go. That's not tuna. Oh, yes, it is. I've had tuna. Jake, it's tuna. Now, why don't you just take a little bite. Here. Dip it in the soy sauce first. There you go. Have a bite. You know, there's a girl at school, Elizabeth Kurzner and her mom ate a bunch of sushi, and it had worms. And they grew in her and crawled out of her eyes. - Oh, no, they didn't. - How do you know? - Just take a little bite. - Okay. - Jake! - It's gross. It tastes like worms. Jake, stop spitting on my rug. - Where do you want me to spit? - Don't spit at all. - I gotta get the taste out. - Have some ginger. - No, Jake, that's wasabi. - What? Are you trying to kill me? No, Jake, don't. That's an expensive pillow. Let Give me that! Okay, here. I've just gotta ask. Playing volleyball on the beach every day, don't you worry about melanoma? Alan, walk with me. Be right back. - What? - Listen closely: No man has ever gotten into a woman's pants chitchatting about skin cancer. You can't possibly know that. Nevertheless. Let's steer the conversation away from tumors, okay? - Okay. So which one do you like? - One? God, in his infinite wisdom, has given us a big box of assorted chocolates and you're just gonna try one? So are you thinking, like, two? I was thinking, like, nine. - But we'll see what happens. - You're not serious. His will be done. What else do we have to eat? You mean other than the $50 worth of sushi in my carpet? Yeah. - I don't suppose you'd eat squab. - No. - Do you even know what it is? - No. But it sounds pretty creepy. "Squab." Well, what would you eat? Pretty much anything, except sushi and squab. Squab, squab. Squab, squab, squab, squab, squab, squab - Stop it. - Sorry. Squab. Would you eat spaghetti? - I love spaghetti. - Great. Would you prefer vermicelli or linguine? Spaghetti. All right. What would you like on it? Puttanesca, Bolognese, Milanese, olive oil with truffles? How about squab? I'm just kidding. Ketchup. - Of course. - And sliced-up hot dogs. Unbelievable. My grandson is a hillbilly. You know, I'm thinking we should move this party over to my place. But we've been playing volleyball all day. We're all sweaty and sticky. No problem. Mi shower es su shower. - What? - I have a shower. - Good. You live alone? - Pretty much. My brother stays with me and he's got a kid, but he's at his grandmother's. Oh, that is so sweet. Yeah, well, we're sweet people. I was raised by my grandma. I called her Nana. - Is that so? - Yeah. I was raised by my grandma. I called her Nana. Oh, yeah. She was a big influence on me. She raised me. I called her Nana. Oh, Jake, what have we done to you? Dinner, such as it is, is served. Jake? Where are you? Come into the dining room! Squab! Alan. Alan, I'm worried about the kid. What kid? Your kid. Our kid. I think we should go to Mom's and get him. Oh, come on, he's fine. And it's just for one night. Which, by the way, is rapidly becoming one of the best nights of my life. And grind, and grind. And step and step and turn. Alan. Alan, please. Hey, if you're worried, why don't you call. And grind, and grind. And grind and grind and grind. - What's her number? - You don't have her on speed dial? Hey, if I can't eat it, bang it or bet on it, it's not in my phone. It's ringing. And grind, and grind. And I'm a lucky boy. Hello? Mom? I can't talk to you now, Charlie. Get that out of your mouth. Are you an animal? Mom? Hello? Hello? And grind, and grind. And step and step and You don't understand, Charlie. It was a women's volleyball team and I could've been the volleyball. - Get your priorities straight, will you? - I've got my priorities straight. I've had a kid for 11 years, but I've never had group sex. Alan, you didn't miss anything. It's an overrated male fantasy. - Really? - No, are you kidding? He'd better be scarred for life. - Mom? - Oh, hello, boys. What happened? Where's Jake? I sent him up to take a bath. He had hot dogs and spaghetti in his hair. Why would he have hot dogs and spaghetti in his hair? Because he wouldn't eat squab. Squab. - What are you guys doing here? - We wanted to see how things were. - They're okay. - See, he's fine. - Let's go back to the bar. - And take me with you. - Jake? - Yeah? Did you turn the water off in the bathtub? - Say goodbye to Grandma. - Goodbye, Grandma. Night, Mom. You realize that in one night, he did what we couldn't do in a lifetime. He broke her. He chewed her up and spit her out. It was a beautiful thing. I'm gonna be truthful here, Alan. I always thought your kid was a little bit of a simpleton. Me too. But clearly, he is the chosen one. Hey, guys, check it out. Pull my finger. Okay. And they shall call him Jake. 





                    			That was very nice, Mindy. Okay. Jake, we're ready to hear your report. - Jake? - Just a sec. Now, Jake. Okay, I'm finished. - Does spelling and grammar count? - It's an oral report, Jake. Oh, so it's like an oral thermometer. Right. Good thing it's not a rectal report. - Just read it. - Okay. "My Weekend, by Jake Harper. Grade five, Mrs. Flanigan's class. Woodward Avenue Elementary School, located on Woodward Avenue." I'm not counting words. Oh, good. "My weekend starts on Friday, when my mom takes me to my dad's house. Which is actually my Uncle Charlie's house. Who is my dad's brother, making him my uncle. His name is Charlie, which is why I call him my Uncle Charlie." Anyway "Even though my parents are divorced, they still get along." - Hey, buddy. - Hey, Dad. - How was your week? - Just fine. - Bye, honey. - Bye, Mom. - Thanks for bringing him. - Bite me. What the hell went on last weekend? - What are you talking about? When I brought him home Sunday night and served him dinner he tipped me with a $25 chip from Caesars Palace and told me I had a nice rack. Well, Judith you do. That's not the point. Where'd he get the chip? Where is he learning this behavior? Hey, Judith. Looking good. Run away, run away. Did you give my son a $25 chip? - No, I did not give him a $25 chip. - Happy? He won it, fair and square. You couldn't run away. I don't care what you do on weekdays. But on weekends, remember you are a role model for an 11 -year-old boy. Oh, that's a bad idea. Who thought of that? I'm warning you. Things had better change or there will be consequences. Legal consequences. Got it? - Got it. - Goodbye. "There will be serious consequences. Legal consequences." "I don't care what you do during the week. But on the weekends, you're a role model." I enjoy talking this way. As do I. "Friday night, I stayed up late. I watched all three Austin Power movies with my dad. We ate Chinese food and Buffalo wings. Dad fell asleep during The Spy Who Shagged Me which, in my opinion, is the strongest of the trilogy. By the way, 'shag' means 'sex' in England." Just read, Jake. That was a footnote. - Read. - Okay. "I woke up later with a stomachache but felt better after I went to the bathroom." If you know what I mean. - Jake. - What? It's not like I said: "I took a dump." "Anyway, I tried to go back to sleep but I couldn 't. Probably because I was thirsty. So I went into the kitchen for what Uncle Charlie calls a 'virgin screwdriver. ' But really it's just a glass of orange juice. It was late, so I decided to skip the glass." Jake? Hang on. That one hurt a little. - What you doing? - Having a virgin screwdriver. - Want some? - No, thanks. I'm good. - What are you doing? - Watching TV. Why isn't it on? Because I've seen this one already. - Hey, you wanna hear a funny joke? - Sure. Why did the blond stare at the juice carton? I don't know. Why? "Cause the carton said 'concentrate.'" That's okay. I didn't get it either. "The next morning I was pretty hungry because" I think you all know why. "So I had a bowl of cereal with my dad, and we made plans for the day." - You wanna go to the museum? - No. I wanna watch TV. It's pretty windy out there. Wanna fly a kite? No. I wanna watch TV. - Hiking? - TV. - I'll get it. - TV. "We decided to watch TV." - Hello. - Is your name Harper? - Yes. - Then this is for you. - Why'd you do that? - Why did you sleep with my wife? Charlie. Busy. I don't care. Open the door. - I've got company. - I know. And her husband's downstairs. Really? - You're married? - Yeah. I'm not in. You have to come and deal with him. - No, I don't. - Yes, you do. I disagree. It's not up for debate. He knows you're here. Oh, man, I hate when this happens. This happens a lot? Not a lot, but enough to be a drag. Charlie, are you coming back to bed? - Yes. - Yes? No "yes." There is an angry husband in your living room. How angry? - Is he packing? - What? - Does he have a weapon? - L He has a stick. That's not good. I could lose an eye. - Charlie! Come on. - Fine, I'll wrap it up here. - Give me 20 minutes. - Oh, no. A better idea. Wrap it up now. - Ten minutes? - Now. We got five minutes. "The weekend was going great, but then something really bad happened." - Hey. - Hello. - Who are you? - I'm Norman. I'm Jake. Have you seen my Game Boy? No. Have you seen my wife? No. Well, if you see it, let me know. Ditto. "I couldn 't believe it. I lost my Game Boy." "I couldn't find my Game Boy in the kitchen or living room so I checked my bedroom and my bathroom. Because, as you may recall, I'd spent a lot of time in there the night before." - He'll be right down. - Thank you. Can I get you a cup of coffee? Decaf. I'm already pretty enraged. Well, that's certainly understandable. I have cookies too. - I wouldn't say no to a cookie. - Good. Come on in the kitchen. I always find a nice cookie can brighten up even the darkest day. Yeah, well, this better be one hell of a cookie. - It's a nice house you got here. - Oh, thank you. Actually, it belongs to my You live in the neighborhood? - Bel-Air. - Oh, that's nice too. Gated community, but the wife gets out anyway. Chews through her leash, huh? Hey, let me get you that cookie. You see like a nice fella. I'm sorry I hit you with my stick. Oh, that's okay. I'm sorry my brother is That's okay. So women, huh? Can't live with them. That's all I got. - You married? - Divorced. - She sleep around? - No, mostly just slept. You're lucky. There's no pain greater than being betrayed by the woman you love. You know, these are really very tasty. Aren't they? - Good morning. - Oh, speaking of tasty cookies Norman, this is Berta. - Hello. - What is this, a fix-up? No, no. Nothing like that. That's good, because I'd probably kill him. Nothing personal, Cotton Top. I just kind of like it rough. - Have another cookie. - Thank you. So is anybody gonna tell me what's going on? Well, it's a little complicated. - Charlie - Got it. Got it? How could you get it? There's a Rolls-Royce in the driveway and I found these hanging on the mailbox so I'm guessing that your brother's got some bimbo upstairs and Norman here is her daddy or her sugar daddy. - Tell me I'm wrong. - I'm the husband. Judges? - You gotta give it to her. - Yes. - I mean, tough break. - Thank you. - You got a gun? - No! - Want one? - Berta! I'm making small talk. Okay. You wanna talk this out like gentlemen, or you? You might've mentioned he fought at the Alamo. - No offense. - None taken. - Does that make us even? - You tell me. Okay. One more. How about that? - He poked you, you poked his - Berta! What? How often do you see that kind of symmetry in life? Hey. Hello. Were you just up in Uncle Charlie's room? - Yeah. - Did you see my Game Boy? No. - Did you see my husband? - The old guy? - Yeah. - He's in the kitchen. Thanks. Well, that's weird. If I was a Game Boy, where would I be? I am so sorry. I had no idea that she was married. I have a firm rule when it comes to sleeping with married women. Yeah, if she's firm enough, he'll do her. Sorry. Isn't there something you could clean? I'm guessing you could use a good scrubbing. Wait a minute. "And suddenly I realized I might have left it in my mom's car." Hey, Mom, did I leave my Game Boy in your car? Well, can you go look? Can't you just dry off and put on a robe? There's another $25 chip in it for you. She wasn't wearing a ring. There was no mention of a husband. Is that supposed to cheer me up? - No, no, no. I just wanted you to know - Now, now. I get it. You're a nice guy, and I married a skeevy tramp. No, no, no. I mean, yeah, I am a nice guy but I'm sure Annette is a lovely woman. Her name is Natalie. - Really? You sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Because I've been yelling "Annette" all night. Her name is Natalie. Well, then maybe this is all just a huge misunderstanding and I've been upstairs doing someone else's wife. Five-foot six, long brown hair, butterfly tattoo on her left hip. Left hip, huh? Hold on now. A lot of women have butterfly tattoos. But the one I slept with also had a little beauty mark in a certain intimate place. I'm not here to claim a lost wallet. Okay, let's just assume it's her. Again, I am really sorry. It's my own fault anyway. I should've realized back when I married her a man my age couldn't satisfy a woman that young. If it makes you feel any better, I couldn't ring her bell, either. - You couldn't? - You don't know me but there's things I don't kid about. So it's not just me. - That's a relief. - Tell me about it. I was killing myself up there. So anyway are we okay? You mean, aside from the fact that you just rolled off my wife? Oh, yeah. We're aces. Good. Thank you. - Can I give you a little advice, kid? - Sure. I was a player once, like you. Do tell. Does the name Tuesday Weld mean anything to you? No. Joey Heatherton? No. The immortal Miss Anne Francis. TV's Honey West. - Sorry. - Well, look them up on your Internet. They were all hot, and I nailed them. Really. Well, kudos. But nothing lasts forever. There's going to come a time when you'll wanna settle down. And I only hope you don't make the same mistake I did. I picked a young hottie because I figured I'd die in the sack with a smile on my face. That's my retirement plan. But it doesn't work that way. What happens is you get your heart broken and you wind up having coffee with some putz who never heard of Honey West. Got it. Thanks for the advice. Well, I'll be getting home now. I got lawyers to call, locks to change. Maybe I'll stop at the market, pick up some of those cookies. - Here. Take the box. - Oh, thanks. Looks like I'm the big winner around here today. - Hello? Anybody home? - Hello. - Hello. Who are you? - Norman. Oh, hello, Norman. I'm Evelyn. Is that your magnificent Rolls-Royce out in the drive? Why, yes, it is. - Are you a friend of Charlie's? - No. But my wife is. Did my son polish your trophy wife? Well, you seem like a very intelligent man. I assume you had an airtight prenup. Bulletproof. You know what, Norman? You look a lot like my fifth husband. Really? How many times you been married? Four. Cookie? "When Grandma came over, I thought things couldn't get any worse. But instead of making me visit she gave my dad money to take me, my uncle and Berta to the movies. We saw the Rob Schneider movie where he plays a stupid guy. I had popcorn, nachos and two jumbo red Slurpees. But as you know, you don't buy Slurpees. You rent them." - Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. - Cool your jets. And if you can't cool them, point the nozzle away from me. Oh, God. Mom! - We can't go in right now. - Why not? Because I can't afford to send you to therapy for the rest of your life. What's going on? - Oh, God! - What? What, what, what? Good for Norman. That's getting right back on the horse. - There's a horse in there? - No, no. No horse. - Well, I still have to pee. - So go water that bush over there. "And so I did. And it just goes to show it's always in the last place you look." Very nice, Jake. "Then on Sunday, we all went out for breakfast with Grandma and Uncle Norman. I had chocolate-chip pancakes with blueberry syrup and bacon. Dad had scrambled eggs but with no yolks. Just the whites. They looked like mashed potatoes. Then the kid next to us threw up his waffles. It was awesome." - So, what's new in school? - Almost got an A on my paper. What do you mean "almost"? Got a C. Okay, that's That's fine. That's an improvement. Minus. Still, here's your dollar. You're paying him for a C-minus? That was our deal. A buck for every C, a car for every A. - A car? - Safest bet in the world. - So, what was the report about? - What we did last weekend. - No kidding? - Yeah. And guess what else happened. Trevor Griffin saw a ginormous rat in the cafeteria. Yeah, but about the paper. You wrote about everything that happened here last weekend? Well, everything but the boring stuff. Oh, this could be problematic. No, it's called "summarizing." - Can I see it? - Sure. But it's at Mom's house. I gave it to her to read this weekend. He's 11. There's no way it stands up in court. Does this smell funny to you?   





                    			I'm sure she's a lovely girl, Mom but I have a strict policy against blind dates.
 Yes, I know I'm not God's gift to women, but nevertheless.
 Oh, come on, how do you know what she can suck through a garden hose? It doesn't matter, the policy stands.
 Okay, bye.
 You know, while I applaud your blind date policy I would encourage you to consider a garden hose exemption.
 I'm sorry, but you remember the last time I let Mom fix me up.
 Oh, yeah, the enema freak.
 She was a colonic irrigation therapist.
 Tomato, tomahto.
 You still wound up with five gallons of coffee up your keister.
 Not a pleasant memory.
 Oh, I can't remember it without chuckling.
 These days they'll open a Starbucks anywhere.
 - Are you done? - No, wait, one more.
 You had the Venti nonfat crap-puccino with extra foam.
 No, okay, I'm done.
 So, what's wrong with the TV? The storm last night messed up the satellite dish.
 I'll call the guy on Monday.
 That's your answer for everything.
 "Call the guy.
 " Not for everything.
 Often, I'll call the girl.
 Of course there was the one time that the girl turned out to be the guy.
 Needless to say, I got a full cash refund.
 You don't have to call the guy this time.
 You adjust the dish till the signal clears up.
 Which is what the guy will do on Monday.
 But Jake is coming tonight.
 Do you wanna listen to him complain about the TV all weekend? I can deal with Jake.
 It's your whining that makes me wanna hang myself.
 Come on, help me get the ladder.
 I'll go up on the roof and we'll fix it in five minutes.
 I have a ladder? How did I get a ladder? For the life of me, I can't remember buying a ladder.
 Well, apparently you did.
 But why? - And how did I get it home? - I really couldn't tell you.
 Did I rent a truck? Who knows? I'm telling you, we got a real mystery on our hands.
 Yeah, it's a puzzler.
 Now, I'm gonna go up and adjust the dish and you go look at the TV and tell me when the picture improves.
 All right.
 I still think we should call the guy.
 Will you forget the guy? I'm the guy.
 - Charlie.
 - Yeah? There's a pair of panties up here.
 Of course, the ladder.
 - Alan, mystery solved.
 - What? Never mind.
 Focus on the job at hand.
 - Are you watching the TV? - Y es.
 How does it look now? It's a little better.
 How about now? No, no, no.
 That's worse.
 - Move it the other way.
 - What? I said, move it the other way.
 - There, there, there.
 That's perfect.
 - What? I said that's perfect.
 Great.
 Coming down.
 Did you say something? I told you.
 We should have called the guy.
 Oh, you wanna flip me the bird, but the poor little fellow can't fly.
 Just help me lie down.
 - There is a bright side here, you know.
 - Oh, really? Really? And what might the bright side be? Handicapped parking? Pity sex? You know, I can see there's gonna be no talking to you about this.
 Oh, do me a favor and call Judith and tell her not to bring Jake over.
 How come? Look at me, Charlie.
 I have abrasions, contusions, a severely sprained neck two fractured fingers, and I'm hopped up on pain pills.
 Does that spell weekend dad to you? Actually, to me it spells: "Weekend in Bangkok with two Olympic gymnasts.
 " But that's a whole other story.
 Look, I got no plans for the weekend.
 I could take care of Jake.
 - Bangkok? - It was the '80s.
 A simpler time.
 The dollar was strong.
 I was looking forward to hanging out with the knucklehead.
 Let him come over.
 I can't help you.
 What will you do all weekend? I don't know.
 Hey, maybe I'll get a chute.
 We could play Chutes and Ladders.
 You see.
 See, that's why I want Jake here.
 He has a sense of humor.
 Oh, all right.
 If you think you can handle it.
 Don't worry, I got everything covered.
 - Thank you.
 - You're welcome.
 Is there anything I can do for you now? Well, I gotta pee.
 Yeah, so? So I can't undo my pants or anything.
 Where are we headed with this, Alan? You said you'd help me.
 I was thinking like I could make you a sandwich.
 - Charlie! - Hey, I am not reaching into your pants.
 Well, what am I supposed to do? Go stand in the surf.
 Come on, grow up.
 - Where are you going? - T o the bathroom.
 Now, come on and unzip me.
 Just like that? Right to it? No dinner? No movie? Charlie! Hold on.
 Coming.
 Holy God.
 Charlie, can you get the door? Charlie? Hang on.
 Charlie! Oh, great, I think I just punctured a lung.
 "Don't worry, Alan.
 I've got everything covered.
 " I'm coming.
 You need to start your report this weekend.
 Why? It's not due till next Wednesday.
 - I've plenty of time.
 - You said that last time.
 - No, I didn't.
 - Yes, you did.
 I think you're getting senile.
 Watch your mouth, young man.
 I can't watch it.
 It's under my nose.
 - Hello.
 - What happened to you? Well, most recently, I was hit in the head by a door.
 But before that, I was fixing the satellite dish on the roof and I kind of fell.
 Why didn't you just call the guy? For God's sake, Alan, how do you intend to look after him this weekend? I am in excruciating pain, but I appreciate your concern.
 Oh, well, you could've picked up a phone and given me a heads up.
 Pick up the phone? Judith, I needed barbecue tongs to take a leak.
 Can you look after Jake or not? - Charlie said he'd look after him.
 - Like hell.
 There's no way I'll let your degenerate brother be responsible for my son.
 Sure, don't ask me what I want.
 Just boss me around like you're my boss or something.
 Charlie will be fine.
 Have a good weekend.
 Thanks.
 You too.
 Hey, can we go out to dinner tonight? Do I look like I'm in any shape to go to dinner? I don't know.
 I'm not a doctor.
 - The answer is no.
 - Okay.
 Then can we go to the video store and rent the new "Final Fantasy"? Jake, I hurt myself.
 I'm in a lot of pain.
 So? When I took a soccer ball to the nads, I was in a lot of pain and all my coach said was, "Walk it off.
 " Well, you can't just walk this off.
 Not with that attitude.
 Hey, there he is.
 How's it going, buddy? My life stinks.
 Cheer up, you're still a kid.
 It's gonna get much worse.
 - Where have you been? - Taking a nap.
 - Why? - I find it refreshes me.
 You said you were gonna take care of everything.
 Yeah, so? So while you were sleeping, I had to answer the door.
 Do you realize how petty you sound right now? - Relax, lie down, I got it covered.
 - No, you don't.
 Nothing is covered.
 It's all coverless.
 Now, there is a life that stinks.
 What's the agenda? What do you want? - I wanna go out to dinner.
 - Yeah, well, I want my own talk show.
 You'll eat what we've got.
 Why can't we go out? Alan, I can't deal with this.
 Talk to your son.
 That's it? You're done covering? I didn't know he was gonna be impossible.
 - Don't talk about me like I'm not here.
 - Keep yapping and you won't be.
 - Charlie, just take him to dinner.
 - Why should I? He's not gonna shut up till he gets it.
 That's true.
 I'll drive you crazy.
 Yeah, well, do your worst.
 If we go out to dinner, there's nothing to clean up.
 We're not going out.
 - You usually wanna go out to dinner.
 - Not tonight.
 You're not punishing me, you're just punishing yourself.
 Back off, bobblehead.
 Oh, come on, it'll be fun.
 - We're not going.
 - Why not? - This conversation's over.
 - Not if I keep talking.
 So where do you wanna eat? Clucky's.
 What's Clucky's? Zesty fire-roasted chicken with Grandma Clucky's secret herbs and spices.
 All right, where is it? There's several convenient locations.
 Like where? I don't know.
 I just sit in the car.
 I've never seen a Clucky's here.
 - How about a pizza? - No.
 - Burgers? - No.
 Sushi? - Italian? Chinese? - No.
 - Clucky's? - No.
 You're not even listening.
 I mean yes.
 Clucky's.
 I'm not driving all over the city hoping to stumble across a Clucky's.
 This isn't the Clucky's my mom takes me to.
 No kidding.
 Where are we anyway? It's called Watts.
 Hurry up and finish your chicken.
 I like the Cajun Clucky's better.
 Good for you.
 - Can I go back and get Cajun Clucky's? - No, eat what you got.
 - But I like the Cajun Clucky's.
 - Why did you order the regular Clucky's? Because I forgot I like the Cajun Clucky's.
 Oh, just eat the freaking chicken.
 Fine.
 Why do you say freaking? I know what you mean.
 - I'm not a little kid anymore.
 - Eat.
 Don't talk.
 Eat! What's up? I gotta pee.
 Charlie, get the tongs.
 Charlie? Gotta pee, gotta pee, Gotta pee, pee, pee Gotta pee, pee, pee Gotta pee, gotta pee, Gotta pee, pee, pee, gotta pee Alan, I've got somebody who wants to meet you.
 Not a good time, Mom.
 Y es, I can see that.
 Are you all right? No, not really.
 Oh, my poor baby.
 Well, anyway, Mona, Alan.
 Alan, Mona.
 Hi, Mona.
 Hello.
 What happened to you? I was fixing a satellite dish and I fell off the roof.
 Well, why didn't you just call the guy? You wanna know why I didn't call the guy? I'll tell you why I didn't call the guy.
 Because you don't need to call the guy.
 It's a simple adjustment that any idiot can do.
 And, yes, I know, this idiot fell off the roof but it was after I fixed it all by myself, no guy.
 Okay, the ice has been broken.
 I'll just give you Mona's number and you can call her some time when it's more convenient.
 Come along, dear.
 Do you just stay awake nights trying to think of new ways to embarrass me? Still gotta pee.
 Oh, God.
 Oh, what the hell.
 Oh, yeah.
 The Cajun Clucky's is way better.
 I'll notify Zagats.
 Before we stop at the video store, can we get ice cream? - Who said we're stopping? - I wanna rent the new "Final Fantasy.
 " Y eah, well, I want my $80,000 Mercedes not to smell like chicken.
 But life is full of little disappointments.
 Okay, forget the ice cream.
 We'll just stop at the video store.
 Jake, I'm tired, I've got a headache.
 I just paid $100 to get my car back from the "chicken valet.
 " And I wanna go home.
 Please? I'm sorry.
 What part of no did you not understand? The "nnn" or the "ooo"? How about if we stop in front of the store I'll run in, get the video game, and you wait in the car? How about we stop by the video store and I just stuff you through the return slot? I wouldn't fit.
 Try me.
 Oh, come on, it will only take a minute.
 You might be able to bully your parents into doing whatever you want but when I say no, that's it.
 Okay.
 Then I guess I won't have a video game to play this weekend.
 Exactly.
 You'll find something else to do.
 Right.
 It will just be you and me.
 - They're all out of "Final Fantasy.
 " - So get something else.
 But I want "Final Fantasy.
 " Are you telling me that out of this store thousands of movies and video games, there's nothing here that interests you? You're not gonna like the answer.
 I'm having chest pains.
 You're giving me chest pains.
 I bet they have "Final Fantasy" at another store.
 You want a final fantasy? Close your eyes and imagine yourself flying across a freaking video store because that's what's about to happen.
 Again with the freaking.
 Excuse me, but did I hear you say you were looking for "Final Fantasy"? I was about to return one, you can have it.
 - Thanks.
 - You're welcome.
 - Oh, he's really something, isn't he? - Oh, yeah, he's something.
 The question is, what? I have a boy his age.
 - Single mom.
 - Single uncle.
 - Betsy.
 - Charlie.
 - Jake.
 - Nobody asked you.
 Betsy, maybe we can get the boys together for a little play date some time.
 I don't want a play date with some stupid kid just so you can have sex with her.
 Isn't he something? Yeah.
 Well, it was nice meeting you.
 Bye-bye.
 What? Are you happy? Pretty much.
 You? Hello.
 "Controlled substance.
 Do not exceed one pill every six hours.
 " Yeah, right.
 What fresh childproof hell is this? Come on, you bastard.
 Yes.
 - What are we doing? - I'm taking you back to your mother.
 Why? Why? I'll tell you why.
 Because you're no fun anymore.
 Because the whole "isn't he cute" thing is over.
 I tell you, if this is a prelude to what you'll be as a teenager then we've got a serious problem.
 Whatever.
 You see, right there, that attitude does not fly with me.
 Whatever.
 God, I hope that's the chicken.
 She's not home.
 Do not "ha-ha" me.
 Never "ha-ha" me.
 Judith, come get your kid.
 Don't hide behind the couch.
 I can see you, Judith.
 Hey, how about some ice cream? Sure.
 Listen, I'm sorry I lost my temper.
 Sorry you slipped in dog crap chasing me.
 Thank you.
 Now, you know that I love you but we gotta be clear on a couple of things.
 I get that you're growing up, your body's changing your emotions are in flux.
 But the important thing you need to keep in mind is that I don't care.
 When you're in my house, when you're out with me and especially when we're around women you will be adorable, got it? I'm trying to concentrate.
 Don't shush me.
 Never shush me.
 Whatever.
 Please be the chicken.
 Pour me one of those, will you? You know, mixing those pills with alcohol is a really bad idea.
 Not if you're trying to die.
 Hey, how many of those pills you got left? SDl Media Group   






                    			Doc, how many more adjustments do you think I'm gonna need? Well, Mr.
 Malinkovich, let's see.
 My son won't graduate college till 2015 so a lot.
 See you next time.
 Okay, Mr.
 Dunlop.
 It's good to see you again, sir.
 And how are we doing today? Not good.
 I was making love to my wife last night Oh, my God, is she okay? She's fine.
 She was on top.
 But my back went out, doc.
 Okay, well, let's get you on the table and get to work.
 Whoa, steady there big fella.
 I took some pain pills my wife had left over from her C-section.
 - I guess my legs are a little rubbery.
 - Well, how many pills did you take? Well, let's see.
 One when I went to bed, one when I got up.
 Seven.
 Really? You know it's not usually a good idea to pop class A narcotics like Skittles.
 - I gotta lie down.
 - Okay, okay, but not here, not now.
 No, no, no.
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, my God.
 Mr.
 Dunlop? Mr.
 Dunlop, you need to get up.
 Help.
 Fire.
 Big giant guy.
 Oh, perfect.
 Dr.
 Harper speaking.
 Judith, this is not a good time.
 I'm with a patient.
 Well, what about Jake? Well, no, I can't pick him up at school now.
 Why can't you do it? You're not the only one under pressure, Judith.
 All right, all right.
 I'll call Charlie and have him pick him up.
 Hey, hey, stop that.
 Hey, stop that.
 Do you need to get it? No, the machine will pick up.
 Hey, it's Charlie.
 Do your thing when you hear the beep.
 Charlie, I need your help.
 Oh, pick up, pick up, pick up.
 Oh, for God's sake.
 See? Hey, look who's here.
 - Hi.
 - How come you' re not in school? He got sent home for misbehaving.
 Well, it's about time.
 When I was your age, I had already been arrested twice.
 Charlie, don't.
 No convictions.
 I had a bad day.
 I had to cancel all my patients -  and close my office to pick him up.
 - Wow, what a drag.
 I got new video games.
 You wanna play? - Sure.
 - Did you forget you're punished? No, why does Uncle Charlie have to suffer? Go to your room.
 In some countries you're innocent until proven guilty.
 You confessed.
 Oh, yeah.
 And that country you're thinking of is this one, genius.
 - What did he do? - Something awful.
 How awful? These are all multi-player games.
 Apparently, there is a little girl in Jake's class named Barbara Schmidt who is a little more physically developed than the other girls.
 And Jake decided to make a picture of her and pass it around.
 I only passed it to one person.
 What happened after that was not my responsibility.
 Dude, why did you sign it? Okay, that part I regret.
 Go back to your room.
 "Boobra Schmidt.
 " I'm putting this one on the refrigerator.
 - Charlie, this is serious.
 - It really speaks to me.
 The girl went home in tears.
 Her mother is on the warpath.
 - Jake could get expelled.
 - For a silly drawing? It's considered sexual harassment.
 The school has a zero tolerance policy.
 For the good old days when you could wander into the girls' locker room pretending you were blind.
 You actually did that? That's horrible.
 No, the horrible part was stealing the dog from the blind kid.
 Well, unfortunately, times have changed and we no longer live in a Porky's movie.
 What's a Porky's movie? Close the door.
 I'll be in to talk with you in a minute.
 Go easy on him.
 He doesn't understand what he did wrong.
 He's right.
 I don't have a clue.
 I thought I told you to close the door.
 It is closed.
 - Go in your room.
 - Fine.
 You know what, maybe I should talk to him.
 Oh, now you wanna help? What's that supposed to mean? It means why didn't you pick up the phone when I needed you this afternoon? I didn't want to.
 See, see? I can't depend on you.
 I never have been able to depend on you.
 I never will be.
 - You know why? - Because I'm undependable? Yes, yes.
 Undependable and selfish.
 And frankly, I'm the idiot.
 I've deluded myself into believing that when I desperately needed my brother to pick up my kid he might actually bother to pick up the freaking phone.
 Okay, okay, in my defense, I really didn't want to.
 Okay, you're right.
 I'm sorry, I should have picked up the phone.
 Forget it.
 What's done is done.
 No sense grinding on it.
 Thank you.
 I just have to accept the fact that I can't count on anyone.
 Least of all an emotionally immature narcissist who thinks the sun rises out of his navel, sets in his scrotum and only cares about what lies between the two.
 Okay, I'm no expert, but that sounds a lot like grinding.
 I am done talking to you.
 Oh, come on, Alan, I said I was sorry.
 Give me another chance.
 For what? To let me down? Tell me what I can do.
 Name something.
 Anything.
 Okay, I have to go to Jake's school if I can keep him from being expelled.
 You want me to go? I am there.
 Count on me.
 No, my receptionist is out sick all week.
 And I need somebody to handle the phones while I'm gone.
 - In your office? - Yes.
 Way out in the valley? Yes.
 All day? Yes.
 Gee, tomorrow is not really good for me.
 All right.
 All right, what time? - The office opens at 8.
 - O'clock? No, degrees.
 No reason to be snide, I don't wanna be late.
 Fine.
 We leave at 7.
 O'clock? Okay, Charlie, time to get up and go to work.
 Charlie? Of course.
 Never even came home.
 Why help your only brother when you can be out boffing total strangers? "I'll be there for you.
 You can count on me.
 " My own fault.
 I'm just stupid and gullible And annoying.
 Don't forget annoying.
 - You're here? - You said 7:00, right? - You got yourself up? - Didn't have to.
 - Why not.
 - Didn't sleep.
 - You haven't been to bed? - Not my bed.
 You want coffee? I made some coffee.
 It's good coffee.
 No more coffee.
 Why don't you make some more coffee while I go take a squirt? - Morning.
 - Berta.
 Berta, Berta, Bert, Bert, Bert.
 - He just getting home? - Y eah.
 You gotta wonder how long he'd keep burning that penis at both ends.
 I try not to think about it.
 Listen, Charlie's coming with me to work today.
 - Why? - He's gonna help me at the office.
 You wanna bet? - What's up with Uncle Charlie? - What do you mean? He's peeing off the deck.
 I thought we weren't allowed to.
 - We're not.
 - We're not? No, we're not.
 Okay.
 What's the Oompa Loompa doing here on a weekday? - He got suspended from school.
 - Why isn't he with his mother? Judith had a little liposuction yesterday and she needs to stay in bed until she stops leaking fat.
 Yeah, I hate it when that happens.
 So, what did the melon-head do? Oh, it's a long story.
 Worth a thousand words.
 Come on, Charlie, let's go.
 Hang on.
 I'm not done yet.
 Oh, will you leave the sea gulls alone for crying out loud? So you like making fun of girls with big boobs? Not anymore.
 Gridlock.
 Stop.
 People do this every day? Drive to work at eight miles an hour? Pretty much.
 I'd have to kill myself.
 - Oh, click.
 - What? I just had a phenomenal business idea.
 They haven't perfected personal jetpacks yet.
 Okay, I have another one.
 We buy a doughnut machine and put it in your trunk.
 Let's go back to the jetpacks.
 Hear me out.
 Next time you're stuck in a traffic jam just pop your trunk and sell doughnuts to all the other drivers.
 We'll call them Gridnuts.
 Trunk Crullers.
 Stop 'n' Go-Nuts.
 - Charlie? - Yeah? - Please stop talking.
 - Okay.
 I got it.
 Trunkin' Donuts.
 Here it is.
 The chiropractic offices of Dr.
 Alan Harper.
 This is where you come every day? Yep.
 For 11 years.
 What do you think? I would have killed myself Okay.
 Now, all you have to do is sit here.
 And when the phone rings, pick it up and say, "Dr.
 Harper's office.
 " So right off the bat, I lie? I am a doctor, Charlie.
 Y eah, and I'm king of the traffic doughnuts.
 Moving on.
 I've canceled all the morning appointments the only thing you're gonna deal with is walk-ins.
 Have them make an appointment for another time.
 So I don't get to crack anybody's back? Charlie, listen to me very carefully.
 You must not touch the patients.
 This is not me talking.
 This is the State of California.
 - Okay.
 - Let me be absolutely clear.
 No touching the patients.
 Got it.
 What did I just say to you? Repeat it back to me.
 Boy, you're really not a morning person, are you? All right, I gotta go get to Jake's school.
 Say a prayer that I can keep him from being expelled.
 Don't worry about a thing.
 It's under control.
 You can count on me.
 Oh, if I could believe even one of those things.
 Okay.
 Where can I hang myself? Hello.
 Oh, hey, Alan.
 I said, "Dr.
 Harper's office.
 " I did.
 You know what, call back and give me another chance.
 Hello.
 Damn, try it again.
 - Are you waiting to see the principal? - Yeah.
 - Oh, have a seat.
 - Oh, thank you.
 - Alan.
 - Mindy.
 - Nice to meet you.
 - You too.
 You must be Boobra's mom.
 Barbara's mams.
 Hi.
 Don't worry, Alan.
 I'm not touching the patients.
 There are human lives at stake here, man.
 I need those spines delivered immediately.
 Hello.
 Can I give you a complimentary adjustment? I'm here for the masseuse position.
 I see.
 Well, I'm really not authorized to do any hiring but you're obviously qualified.
 So the hell with protocol, welcome aboard.
 Let me tell you, puberty is hard enough for a young girl without having to be leered at and made fun of by obnoxious little boys.
 I couldn't agree with you more.
 I assure you I've had a talk with Jake about how wrong it is to objectify women's Up here.
 I'm up here.
 I know.
 I know.
 I see you.
 And let me tell you something.
 There is no one more sympathetic than I to the plight of the large-breasted woman.
 Plight? It's not an affliction.
 Well, no, not the breasts themselves but the attendant back problems associated with carrying the enormous load.
 So now my breasts are a load? From a strictly engineering standpoint, yes.
 See, see, I am a chiropractor.
 And I deal with the heartache of MMS all the time.
 - MMS? - Massive Mammary Syndrome.
 A term I coined in an article I submitted to the Journal of the American Chiropractic Association.
 It hasn't really caught on.
 Anyway, MMS is particularly acute among strippers but they bring it on themselves with those humongous implants.
 Yours, on the other hand, appear quite natural.
 God given, am I right? What the hell is wrong with you? I don't know.
 I was a bottle baby.
 I'm sorry, Dr.
 Harper's not in this morning.
 If your back's bothering you, we do have a masseuse on duty.
 Fine.
 Anything.
 Let's see, she just went in with a patient about five minutes ago.
 - So if you don't mind waiting - Thank you, that was great.
 Good.
 Come back soon.
 Soon? I'll be back after lunch.
 - You next? - Oh, please.
 Let's go.
 - What's this? - Your cut.
 Click! - I am really sorry.
 - Just drop it.
 You know, in my defense Well, well, in the defense of all men we do live in a mammo-centric society.
 Mammo-centric? Another coinage of mine.
 Hasn't really permeated the cultural Zeitgeist.
 Hey, bottle baby, I'm up here.
 That perfectly illustrates my points.
 Point.
 From the moment we are born, we are basically bombarded by breasts.
 Breasts in advertising, breasts in television, in movies.
 Here a breast, there a breast, everywhere a breast-breast.
 Heck, you can understand the fixation.
 You're a horrible little man.
 Okay, I had hoped that we could have a spirited exchange of ideas here.
 But if we are gonna just degenerate into name-calling we should wait for the principal to decide what a reasonable punishment -  for my son would be.
 - Fine.
 We'll let the principal decide.
 Okay.
 I'm Principal Gallagher.
 Oh, God, my boy's gonna get the chair.
 Time.
 Man, is this day ever gonna end? Hey, Alan.
 What's going on here? I had another business idea.
 - You what? - Hear me out.
 What do men like better than doughnuts? Hang on.
 Time.
 Four thousand two hundred, I hate singles.
 Don't you hate singles? You turned my business into a brothel.
 I thought you'd be proud of me.
 I didn't touch a single patient.
 I left you alone for a couple of hours and you turned my business into a brothel.
 You know what you need? A nice, relaxing massage.
 Oh, shut up.
 There is a happy ending here.
 From what I saw, there was like 40 of them.
 And that's just what's on the books.
 I don't want to know about it.
 I never wanna know about it.
 - Okay, we'll change the subject.
 - Thank you.
 - How did it go at Jake's school? - I don't want to talk about it.
 I never wanna talk about it.
 - You screwed up, huh? - In ways you can't imagine.
 So he's expelled? No, he's just suspended for the week.
 That's not so bad.
 It's already Wednesday.
 I have been asked never to set foot on the grounds of Woodward Avenue Elementary School.
 - No kidding.
 - And it was suggested that I resign from the PT A.
 And there's talk of a civil suit.
 Principal Gallagher's lesbian lover might just drop by tonight to kick my ass.
 Remind me to charge the camcorder.
 Oh, click, another great business idea.
 - I don't wanna hear it.
 - Just listen.
 We put a massage table in the trunk of your car.
 - Forget it, Charlie.
 - We'd probably need a van.
 - I'm not listening.
 - Oh, come on.
 Who needs their tension relieved more than guys stuck in traffic? We'll call it, Bumper to Humper.
 Speed Humps.
 I got it.
 Jiffy Lube.
 Oh, wait, somebody already has that.

 - So go brush them.
 - I brushed them this morning.
 - So go floss them.
 - Oh, gross.
 Wait.
 I got it.
 No, that's chicken.
 When did we have chicken? You didn't brush this morning, did you? Between you and me, I lost my toothbrush three days ago.
 Still good.
 Hey, have you met any of the ladies my dad's been dating? - No.
 You? - No.
 More chicken? Fingernail.
 Yours? I hope so.
 So how come I don't get to meet Dad's dates? I don't know, maybe because you're disgusting.
 No, come on, really.
 I'm not kidding.
 For most women, you're a deal breaker.
 You used to say I was a babe magnet.
 You used to be little and cute.
 Now you're just old and in the way.
 That's very hurtful, Uncle Charlie.
 The truth is your dad doesn't want you to get attached to these women in case the relationship doesn't work.
 Why? He loves you very much and he cares about your feelings.
 You let me meet your dates.
 And what does that tell you? I have no idea.
 Hello? Hi, Dad.
 What are you doing up so late? Charlie, what is he doing up? He's asleep.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 - Charlie.
 - What? Oh, hey, Alan.
 What is he doing up so late? I told him to go to bed.
 How many times did I tell you? Boy, I lost count.
 See? - So how was your date? - It was fine.
 Did you get any? - Did I get any what? - Hang on.
 What's he supposed to get? I swear I don't know what he's talking about.
 Go to bed.
 - What are you teaching him? - What difference does it make? The only thing he retains is little shards of chicken.
 Wonderful.
 So did you get any? A nice evening.
 We had a lovely dinner.
 For the record, a lovely dinner doesn't necessarily preclude carpet burns and a bite mark on your ass.
 In this case, it was just dinner and pleasant conversation.
 Well, that's why God gave us Cinemax and an opposable thumb.
 Good evening.
 Alan, the kid was asking about these women you've been going out with.
 Why he never meets them.
 Really? What did you tell him? I said it's probably because he's disgusting.
 Oh, Charlie I also told him that you love him, you don't want him to get attached be disappointed if things don't work.
 Good.
 Thank you.
 But how come I don't get to meet them? Because you're disgusting.
 That's very hurtful, Alan.
 Come on, really.
 What's the big secret with these women? Boy, I really don't wanna get into it.
 - They're hideous, right? - No.
 - Insufferable? Inflatable? - No.
 - Are you insane? - Insane.
 Are they insane? - Leave me alone.
 - Come on, give me a hint.
 When you go to pick them up do you need a Border collie to cut them off? Stop it.
 I'm never gonna stop, Alan.
 You know me better than that.
 Okay, fine.
 I'll tell you.
 First of all, there's no women.
 Imaginary.
 My next guess was gonna be imaginary.
 Let me finish.
 It's just one woman.
 I've been seeing the same woman for weeks.
 - I see.
 You've been playing it slow.
 - Yes.
 And by slow I mean gay.
 I can't talk to you about this.
 Alan, you hook a fish and play it too long.
 You know what you have when you reel it in? - What? - A tired fish that thinks you're gay.
 Do you drink while you're babysitting my son? Not at first, but he wears me down.
 - So, what's the deal with this broad? - She's not a broad.
 It's Judith.
 - Your ex-wife? - Yep.
 Okay, okay.
 That's not fair.
 You said no to insufferable and insane.
 - Very funny.
 - Are you serious? And by serious I mean dumber than a bag of doorknobs.
 Look, we went out to dinner weeks ago to talk about getting Jake into middle school.
 Before you know it, we're laughing, having a great time.
 I can see the humor in trying to get the little bonehead into a good school.
 But that doesn't mean you start dating your ex-wife.
 I know what you're thinking.
 I'm being naive and romantic.
 Not even close.
 You can't overlook the fact that we still have a lot in common.
 Yeah, neither of you have any respect for you.
 The point is, she wants to give it another try and so do I.
 We can't let Jake know, we don't want him to get his hopes up.
 Oh, buddy, why don't you just take an electric sander to your testicles? We're both adults, we're aware of the pitfalls and we think it's worth the risk.
 Okay, fine.
 I wish you both nothing but happiness.
 Thank you.
 Hello.
 Hello.
 What's going on? Sit down, Alan.
 We need to talk.
 Yeah, well, listen, I'd love to but I've gotta wake up Jake so we can Let him sleep.
 Am I getting whacked? It was discussed, but I was overruled.
 Sit down.
 Alan, we're all here because we love you.
 And we don't wanna see you make a terrible mistake.
 I'm just waiting for my toaster strudel to pop.
 There we go.
 You told on me.
 Hey, you wouldn't listen to reason, so now you're gonna listen to Mom.
 Alan, sweetheart, you know, I only want the best for you, right? I do.
 I do.
 Which is why when Judith threw you out, I was there supporting you.
 - You had other options? - Don't be naive.
 I could have sucked up to Judith in order to have more access to my grandson.
 But no, I burned that bridge.
 I said horrible things to her that I can never take back.
 Keep in mind, this is a woman who worked the phrase "mousy bitch" into her wedding toast.
 So if you two reconcile, I'll have to apologize to her.
 - So? - I'd rather kill us all.
 Okay, moving on.
 Rose? Do you have something you'd like to say? Yes, thank you.
 Alan, when I first met you, I didn't care for you at all.
 You were a fussy, whiny control freak.
 Yes? And now? Now it doesn't bother me so much.
 I think what Rose means is that since the divorce, you've grown you've been reborn.
 That's not what I meant.
 If that was what I meant, that's what I would've said.
 - Sorry.
 - Yeah, you'll get your turn.
 Okay.
 Alan, life is all about moving on.
 Now, in the animal kingdom, sharks move forward while crabs move sideways.
 So the question you have to ask yourself is: Are you a shark or a crab? Which way do Sea-Monkeys move? Okay, that's Judith.
 Now, I thank you for your concern but I would appreciate it if nobody said anything and everybody just stayed out of it.
 Yeah, right.
 - Hey, Mom.
 - Hi, honey.
 Why aren't you dressed? I told you I was picking him up early.
 Why isn't he ready? Get dressed.
 - I'm sorry.
 - You're always sorry but I always play the bad guy.
 - Damn it, Alan.
 - Okay, he's gone.
 - I was thinking about you last night.
 - Really? - What were you thinking? - Just what a nice time I had.
 Yes, yes, it was.
 Alan? Turn around.
 Hi, Judith.
 Hello.
 How are you? Fine.
 Bye, Dad.
 Bye, everybody.
 Bye, Jake.
 - Goodbye.
 - Goodbye.
 - Thanks for staying out of it.
 - You're welcome.
 Hey, Alan.
 Come on out, I got a surprise for you.
 Can it wait? Jake forgot his math book.
 I'll run it to Judith's.
 No, no, no.
 You can't go to Judith's.
 The surprise is ready now.
 Okay.
 What is it? Oh, for God's sake.
 Wait, there's more.
 Twins, Alan.
 I got them for you, but you can share if you want.
 Charlie, no.
 Fine, you can have them both.
 Bad luck to split sisters anyway.
 I don't want them.
 I'm going to Judith's.
 I don't think you're getting the full picture.
 Turn around.
 Show him the full picture.
 That's daily Pilates classes and one meal a month.
 - I'll see you later.
 - Are you sure? Even together, these girls aren't as old as your ex-wife.
 Bye.
 Oh, for the love of God.
 Stop turning.
 Show's over.
 - Isn't he adorable? - Yeah.
 When he's sleeping, he's like a little angel.
 I was planning to have a glass of wine sit in the hot tub before you came.
 I'm sorry.
 I just wanted to be sure he got the book.
 I'll get out.
 Alan.
 Would you like to join me? Well, I didn't bring a bathing suit.
 You don't need a bathing suit.
 Okay.
 Have you been keeping up the chlorine treatments? Without a bathing suit, you're just inviting algae into your privates.
 - I like the new patio furniture.
 - Thanks.
 - What is that, redwood? - Teak.
 Oh, teak.
 That must have set me back a few bucks.
 The salesman said it would pay for itself in five years.
 Oh, really? How is it gonna do that? Is it gonna get a paper route? - It's very nice.
 - Thank you.
 Of course, it's gonna require a lot of upkeep.
 Actually, all wood that's outside requires upkeep except trees.
 They seem to have it down.
 Alan, are you nervous? Yeah, a little.
 I mean, we've been separated for two years.
 I haven't seen you naked for four.
 Except, you know, that one time I walked in on you on the toilet.
 Mom? You out there? Oh, my God.
 What are we gonna do? - Take a deep breath.
 - What? I'm thirsty.
 - Have something to drink.
 - There's no more Goofy Juice.
 - So have some water.
 - Fine.
 - Hey, Mom? - What? I'm hungry too.
 Can you make me a sandwich? - No.
 Have your drink and go to bed.
 - Fine.
 Mom.
 - How about a cookie? - You already brushed your teeth.
 - No, I didn't.
 - You said you did.
 I always say that.
 - Well, then brush them and go to bed.
 - Fine.
 Oh, God.
 Are you okay? There was a bright light and I saw my dead grandma.
 She seemed happy.
 Here, have a little wine.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 That was close.
 Relax, he didn't see you.
 But what if he comes back? Maybe I should go.
 Or we could go upstairs and get in bed.
 Bed? - Our old bed? - My new bed.
 Oh, what was wrong with the old one? - Too many memories.
 - Of what? You pretending to sleep and me watching Letterman? Alan, do you wanna have this conversation? No, I don't.
 But apparently, my mouth has a mind of its own.
 Well, let's put your mouth to better use.
 I can't go back underwater, Judith.
 - Hey, Charlie.
 - Yeah? Not that it's any of my business I couldn't help noticing the matched set of rotating floozies on your deck earlier.
 They were for Alan.
 I was trying to get his mind off of Judith.
 With a night of meaningless, impersonal group sex? What a good brother.
 No, no, a good brother gets him a couple of girls.
 It takes a great brother to get him two from the same egg.
 You know, there is a possibility that we were wrong about this.
 Maybe Alan and Judith can work things out.
 Maybe.
 But if they do -  what happens to Jake? - Grows up in a happy home with a mommy and daddy who love each other? Yeah, but what about me? It's too late for you, Charlie.
 No, I mean, what happens to me and Jake? I'll never get to see him.
 You really love the little guy, huh? Yeah, I guess I do.
 Love hurts, Rose.
 Yes, it does.
 Especially when you've given your heart to someone who barely knows you exist.
 Who insists on plowing through strange, stupid women who could never love him the way you do leaving you to stand outside alone in the night wishing with all your heart that he would come to his senses and realize that his true happiness lies with you and no one else but knowing all the while that it will never happen because he's a selfish, immature, heartless jerk.
 I mean poor baby.
 Okay, I'm gonna stick my neck out here and say that was the best sex we ever had.
 - I agree.
 - Not that it wasn't good before.
 It wasn't.
 Okay, granted.
 Which raises the question: Why is it so much better now? - Does it matter? - Well, no, not really.
 I mean, just curious.
 I mean, I I noticed some new moves on your part and I can't help wondering where you might have picked them up.
 You haven't been with other women in two years? Oh, no, I've been with other women, I just didn't learn anything.
 You, on the other hand, have an entirely new sexual repertoire including a couple of numbers I requested when we were married.
 - Alan - And by requested I mean begged.
 Please don't go there.
 Now, see, that's what I'm used to hearing from you in bed.
 "Don't go there.
 " "Don't touch that.
 " "Leave that alone, it's not a toy.
 " So I've changed.
 I would think you would be happy.
 Well, I was.
 Very happy.
 But then I started to think about it.
 There's no reason you couldn't have changed with me.
 - Oh, please.
 - I gave you every chance.
 I bought tickets to sex seminars, I brought home books and tapes and accessories.
 And what happened? I sat right here reading and watching by myself while eating low-fat love jelly out of the tube.
 Okay, I can see this was a bad idea.
 No, the bad idea was sitting in that filthy hot tub without a bathing suit.
 I can feel mushrooms growing in my crack.
 Just go home, Alan.
 We're not married.
 You can't tell me what to do.
 - Hey, Mom? Does this look infected? - Okay, bye! It's okay, I didn't see anything.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 What are you watching? Soft-core porn.
 Sound's not on.
 I don't need to hear them.
 Aren't those the twins from the deck? Too late now, Alan.
 You could have been delivering that pizza.
 How's Judith? Fine.
 She got some new patio furniture.
 That's nice.
 Teak.
 Put in some rose bushes too.
 How about that.
 And I think the neighbors got a new dog.
 Mean dog.
 Really? Might have been a coyote.
 Hard to say.
 It was dark and I was crying.
 - Anything else? - No.
 Oh, yeah, I saw our dead grandmother.
 - Where? - In the hot tub.
 Oh, that's the cab.
 Could you lend me 60 bucks? I don't have my wallet on me.
 Sure.
 Oh, thank you.
 I suddenly have a craving for pizza.

                    			One, two, three, four, five, six, seven - What are you doing? - Masticating.
 - What? - Don't worry.
 - It doesn't mean what you think.
 - What do you think I think? You know.
 Okay, I know what I know.
 What do you know? I know you're supposed to masticate your food 20 times before you swallow.
 Yeah, but what about the other thing? What other thing? The thing you thought I was thinking.
 I'm sorry, Dad.
 You lost me.
 - Morning.
 - Oh, morning.
 Isn't this your day off? - It is.
 But I need to talk to Charlie.
 - Well, good luck.
 He got home, had a bowl of chili, threw up and went to bed.
 He probably threw up because he didn't masticate enough.
 Hey, potty-mouth, there's a lady present.
 Why don't you tell me what you need then you can go enjoy your day off by spreading sunshine and cheer to others.
 It's about the house.
 I should wait for Charlie.
 I live here too.
 What's the problem? I'll wait.
 Oh, for God's sakes, pretend I'm Charlie.
 Talk to me.
 Okay.
 Charlie, I thought it over.
 If you want me to kill your brother, I'll need the cash up front.
 - Very amusing.
 - Thanks, I've been taking an improv class.
 Okay, here's the deal.
 I got five brothers and sisters.
 I'm the middle child, which probably explains why I'm such a people pleaser.
 Anyhow, my brother Philip, he's the second oldest.
 He's in the roadside fireworks business, which is, as you might expect, seasonal.
 This creates some economic uncertainty, which has strained his marriage.
 Perhaps not as much as him boinking his wife's half-sister.
 But it's a snowball effect.
 Anyway, to make a long story short.
 T oo late.
 Fair enough.
 Berta one, Zippy one.
 Anyway, Philip can't live at his house because technically it's a crime scene.
 - Which is why I wanted to ask Charlie - You want your brother to stay here? Oh, don't be stupid.
 He's staying at my place trying to wean himself off the meth and the codeine and whatnot.
 I wanna stay here for a couple of days.
 - That's okay.
 I'll ask Charlie.
 - No, you don't have to ask Charlie.
 You can ask me.
 Fine.
 Oh, you'd like an answer now.
 That'd be swell.
 Well, I would have to say after due consideration and taking into account all the factors that are involved that it would be our pleasure to have you.
 Super.
 Do you mind if I take your room? - My room? Gee, I - Trust me.
 You want me to have a room with a private crapper.
 Okay.
 By all means.
 - Take my room.
 I'll bunk with Jake.
 - Thanks.
 What do you mean you'll bunk with Jake? - Is that a problem? - Yes, I need my privacy.
 - For what? - You know.
 Never again.
 Never, ever, ever again.
 You gonna quit drinking? Don't be ridiculous.
 I'm gonna quit waking up.
 What are you doing? Is this your day off? It is, but your brother invited me to be your houseguest for a couple of days.
 Did he, now? I was gonna ask you, but Alan said he could speak for both of you.
 Did he, now? - You got a problem with that? - Don't be silly.
 You're like family.
 Yeah, well, I've seen how you treat family.
 Hey, you're always welcome here.
 You don't even have to ask.
 - Morning, Alan.
 - Hey, look, who finally Berta? Living here? Are you insane? She needed a place to stay.
 What would you have said? I would have explained my sincere belief that there are boundaries between employer and employee which exist specifically to protect said employer from accidentally seeing the employee prancing around in her big cotton granny-panties.
 All right.
 Go tell her that.
 Okay, I was bluffing.
 Look, look, it's just for a couple of days.
 We can tough it out.
 But we wouldn't have to if you hadn't presumed to invite someone to stay without my permission.
 Hey, hey, I live here too.
 So do termites.
 But they don't have guest-inviting privileges either.
 - You're equating me with termites? - Hell, no.
 You can get rid of termites.
 You know, if I thought you meant that, I would be really hurt.
 Too subtle? Okay, let me take another tack.
 Do you know why I've never accepted money from you to stay here? I assumed you were being compassionate and generous during a difficult period in my life.
 It's so you can be here and Jake can be here, but it remains my house.
 - Not our house.
 - What's the difference? In my house, what you think, what you want, what you say, doesn't mean squat.
 It's just jibber-jabber.
 So you're saying I have no rights here? I thought that was understood.
 I can't believe we're talking about it.
 I've been living here two years.
 You still consider me a houseguest.
 No, my houseguests bring a bottle of wine and have sex with me.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 I'll go get some chardonnay and assume the position.
 Hey, don't be letting your mouth write checks your ass can't cash.
 Pompous jerk.
 I don't know how you put up with that.
 You heard? We were whispering.
 Must be one of them acoustical anomalies.
 I just think it's criminal, the way Charlie treats you.
 Like some kind of second-class citizen.
 Second class? I aspire to second class.
 You know the pecking order in this house? Charlie.
 Women Charlie sleeps with.
 Charlie's bookie.
 Women Charlie hopes to sleep with.
 Termites.
 Me.
 Well, that's just not right.
 What am I supposed to do? I can't really afford my own place.
 I could, but it certainly wouldn't be on the beach.
 Unless the beach was Guadalcanal.
 It's a shame.
 You paying all that money for an ex-wife and an ex-wife's house and you're not allowed inside either one.
 Exactly.
 I'm a victim here.
 Yeah.
 You got victim written all over you.
 Does my brother sympathize? Do Catholic priests make good babysitters? Listen.
 You want rights and privileges, you gotta demand them.
 Stand up to Charlie.
 Get in his face.
 You know what? You're right.
 - And starting now.
 - Go get him, tiger.
 Come here, Charlie.
 I wanna Oh, that is so wrong.
 - Hey.
 - Hey.
 You know, Charlie, you've really got a beautiful view here.
 You're just noticing that? Well, I spend most of my days looking at dirty toilets and those Rorschach tests you call bed sheets.
 It's nice you get a chance to stop and smell the roses.
 Oh, don't get me started on the smells around here.
 Hey, listen, Berta, you know how I feel about you, right? No, tell me.
 Oh, gee, I could never put it into words.
 Well then show me.
 Relax, I'm just screwing with you.
 Good one.
 Anyway.
 I believe there are certain boundaries between an employer and an employee.
 I think it'd be best if you found Oh, I agree with you about the boundaries.
 I've been keeping quiet about the things your brother says behind your back.
 - What does he say? - I don't wanna cause problems.
 No, no, no, come on, tell me.
 Let's just say that he doesn't always appreciate everything you do for him.
 You know what the problem is? - I'm a soft touch.
 - You do have a big heart.
 And there are always people out there who will take advantage of that.
 - You wouldn't think it'd be your brother.
 - Yeah, that's the saddest part.
 But what can I do about it? Respect's not freely given in this life, Charlie.
 You gotta demand it.
 - It's time for me to stand up for myself.
 - Good for you.
 And while you're up would you get me one of those Japanese beers in the refrigerator? - Oh, sure.
 Be right back.
 - Thanks.
 I'm a bad pussycat.
 Did you know your body doesn't digest corn? It goes out the same way it comes in.
 It's like a little bookmark in your poop.
 Did they teach you that at school? Nope.
 It's the powers of observation.
 Jake, that's not dinner conversation.
 You're right.
 It's dinner corn-versation.
 See what happens when you don't hit your kids? - Hey, something smells good.
 - Meatloaf.
 - Great, I love meatloaf.
 - Well, you should make some.
 I'll give you the recipe.
 You didn't make enough for me? I'm not your chef.
 Is that so? How did you cook the meatloaf? In the oven.
 My oven.
 - What's your point? - My point? Oh, don't put me in the middle.
 I love you both.
 My point is, I'm hungry and I want meatloaf.
 Yeah, well, I'm Alan and I want respect.
 I think I got a better chance at getting meatloaf.
 I'm starting to feel like maybe Jake and I have overstayed our welcome.
 Not at all.
 Jake's still welcome.
 You're the one with the attitude.
 My attitude? I thought my attitude didn't count for anything.
 That it was just jabberwocky.
 Jibber-jabber, you moron.
 Okay, okay, that settles it.
 I think it's time we moved.
 - We? - Yeah, we.
 But I'm still welcome.
 - You'll go where I go.
 - Can we get a place on the beach? Sure, if you don't mind living under a lifeguard stand.
 We managed to get by without your help before we came here, we'll do it again.
 Why do you keep saying "we"? Your problem is you don't appreciate the things I do for you.
 I'm tired of being treated as a second-class citizen.
 Fine.
 You wanna leave, leave.
 Maybe I will.
 - Way to stand up for yourself.
 - Thank you.
 So are we really out of meatloaf or were you just saying that to piss him off? Oh, this looks interesting.
 "Two-bedroom, needs work, up-and-coming neighborhood.
 " What does that mean, up-and-coming neighborhood? The realtor didn't think he could move the house saying drug-ravaged battlefield.
 - Okay, we'll keep looking.
 - Alan, I don't mean to pry.
 But after alimony and child support exactly how much can you afford to spend? Really? - Y es, really.
 - Sweetie, my shoes cost more than this.
 Well, Mom, you have a lot of shoes.
 The ones I'm wearing.
 Based on this amount, you don't need a realtor.
 You need someone who sells camping equipment.
 Yeah, well, that's what I'll do.
 All right.
 But may I propose a simple alternative? I'm not living with you, Mom.
 Okay.
 - Then I have a final alternative.
 - And what would that be? Run straight to your brother's ass and kiss it repeatedly.
 Forget it.
 I can't stay here anymore.
 Hey, Red.
 You wanna top this off for me? Certainly.
 May I get you a short stack and some pork links while I'm at it? No, I'm full.
 But as long as we're discussing dining choices, why don't you bite me? Oh, goodie.
 More loved ones.
 - Good morning, Charlie.
 - Let me guess.
 Alan invited you to move in.
 No.
 She's helping me move out.
 This is a sad day.
 - We're gonna miss you around here, Alan.
 - Thank you.
 Sad, sad, sad.
 Don't you have anything to say, Charlie? Yeah.
 Okay, well, enough of sentiment.
 We should really get going.
 Apartments in your price range are a long drive from Malibu.
 - I know, Mom.
 - A long, long drive.
 Got it.
 Maybe you should go pee-pee before Okay.
 You mind looking after Jake? If it'll help get you out of here, I'll breast-feed him.
 You know, with Zippy out of here you're gonna have that nice guest room just go to waste.
 - Yeah.
 - So I was thinking.
 How about if I become a live-in? A live-in what? Housekeeper.
 Easier for you, easier for me.
 Everybody wins.
 Gee Hold that thought.
 My coffee just kicked in.
 You wanna go down to the arcade and play air hockey? No.
 - Wanna go to a movie? - No.
 Come on, I'll take you to something R- rated.
 See some boobs.
 Just leave me alone.
 - Are you mad at me? - What was your first clue? Well, frankly, your dismissive attitude toward boobs.
 Why are you making us move? You're not moving.
 Well, then why is Dad looking for another place for us to live? Because he's trying to teach me a lesson.
 Why don't you tell him to stop? Because I'm trying to teach him a lesson.
 What's your lesson? That it's my house.
 What's his lesson? That he lives here too.
 Okay, I'm just a kid, but that sounds stupid even to me.
 Well, be that as it may, I give you my word I'm not gonna let you go anywhere.
 - Promise? - Promise.
 Is the boob offer still open? Come on.
 - How do you pronounce her last name? - Hayek.
 Salma Hayek.
 Her name's as pretty as her boobs.
 - Hey.
 - Hey.
 What's all this? Found a place.
 Fully furnished, ready to move in.
 Jake, I packed most of your stuff.
 You may wanna check if I missed anything.
 - Uncle Charlie? - Listen to your father.
 - But you said - I said, listen to your father.
 I'm just a pawn.
 - So where is this place? - In the Valley.
 A lovely Spanish-style complex called Valley Hacienda.
 - Good for you.
 - Two-bedroom.
 Pool, Jacuzzi, rec room.
 - Sounds great.
 - It is.
 And we're going.
 I can see that.
 Well, it's for the best.
 I'll finally have a place that's really mine and you can go back to living the selfish, unexamined life you obviously cherish.
 Looking forward to it.
 Okay, I guess I'm ready to go.
 Well, then, I guess we should go.
 Need some help? No, we can handle it.
 All right.
 Valley Hacienda, here we come.
 Jake, say goodbye to your Uncle Charlie.
 - Bye, Uncle Charlie.
 - Bye, kid.
 Jake, go get in the car.
 Listen to your father.
 I don't think anybody's learning anything here.
 Well, thanks for your hospitality.
 I'm sorry we overstayed our welcome.
 - Alan.
 - I don't wanna go.
 Please don't make me go.
 I love it here.
 I love it so much.
 - I thought you found a nice place.
 - I was bluffing.
 It sucked, they all sucked.
 Do you want me to kiss your ass? Because I will.
 Come on, turn around.
 - Come on.
 - Alan, cut it out.
 I mean it.
 You're the boss.
 I'd rather be a second-class citizen here in paradise than king of a urine-soaked firetrap next to Burbank Airport.
 Alan, Alan, calm down.
 Calm down.
 If you wanna stay, you can stay.
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.
 Charlie, you have no idea how bad it was.
 I couldn't bring a woman to one of these places.
 The only way I'd ever have sex was if I was molested by a rat.
 Pull yourself together.
 Now, go grab Jake and we'll have dinner.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 - And thanks again.
 - You're welcome.
 - Hey, hey, Charlie? - What? Just before I went down on my knees were you about to say something? I don't think so.
 Before I started weeping you were gonna tell me to stay.
 No, I wasn't.
 Okay, you're not fooling anybody.
 You'd miss me if I was gone.
 Despite everything you've said, we're brothers.
 And we have a bond that's deeper and more meaningful than any He folded, didn't he? My ass is covered with lip prints.
 Damn.
 Well, anyway.
 I guess you wanna head home and see how Philip's doing.
 Who? Philip.
 Your brother.
 Detoxing.
 Oh, yeah, sure.
 Philip.
 My brother.
 This isn't so bad.
 Seems reasonably safe.
 Oh, yeah.
 I'm sure the Valley Hacienda crack dealers have organized some sort of neighborhood watch.
 We could make this work.
 I think it's got a lot going for it.
 I'm not a big fan of the orange carpet.
 But part of the fun of a new place is fixing it up, making it your own.
 Slap on a coat of paint and of course, a little bleach to take those blood stains in the tub.
 Or you could run home and kiss your brother's ass repeatedly.
 Couldn't you just say, "I told you so"? SDl Media Group   






                    			Why do you have to leave? Charlie, I have to get home.
 I have to feed my cat.
 - I have to feed my fish.
 - We've been in bed for three days.
 I'm guessing the cat's fed and what's left of the fish is in the Kitty Litter.
 Well, I also have a job.
 - Call in sick.
 - I did it yesterday.
 Okay, call in horny.
 I'll write you a note.
 I wish I could.
 I love being with you.
 Me too.
 And having you here just makes it all the better.
 We've been seeing each other for over two months and you've never spent the night.
 Well, go clean up the dead animals and I'll come over tonight.
 Deal.
 I'll cook you dinner.
 Great.
 I think I love you, Charlie Harper.
 Thank you.
 I'll see you later.
 Wait a minute.
 Did you just say "thank you"? - Did I? - Yes.
 I said, "I think I love you" and you said, "Thank you.
 " - What's that supposed to mean? - Thank you? It's an expression of appreciation.
 Thank you.
 That's it? You don't have anything to add? Thank you so very much.
 Great.
 That's great.
 I open my heart to you and you couldn't care less.
 Well, that's not fair.
 I could care less.
 A lot less.
 What do you want me to do? Lie to you? No, I want you to drop dead, you smug, cold-hearted son of a bitch.
 That could have been ugly.
 Hey, guess what happened at school today.
 - You made the honor roll.
 - What's that? Forget it.
 What happened at school? - Well, there's this girl - Okay, now I'm listening.
 - Her name is Robin Newberry.
 - Name's not important.
 Proceed.
 She gave me a cupcake.
 - Yeah? So? - I think she likes me.
 - So, what's the problem? - Now I think she thinks I like her back.
 - Do you? - I didn't think I did.
 But it was a really good cupcake.
 Wow, talk about your perfect metaphor.
 No, it was a cupcake.
 Okay, blank slate.
 Listen up.
 I'm gonna tell you something that will serve you well for life.
 Like, "When you're peeing outside, always face downwind"? Better.
 By the way, what the hell were you thinking? I was thinking, "Boy, I hope that's really warm rain.
 " Okay, okay.
 Let's focus on today's lesson.
 Never, ever confuse cupcakes with love.
 But I love cupcakes.
 We all love cupcakes.
 That doesn't mean you have to love the baker.
 - Her mom baked it.
 - Missing the point.
 - Robin just helped with the icing.
 - Okay.
 Okay.
 She made a smiley face with Red Hots.
 I get it.
 I'm just saying that when someone freely gives you her cupcake your only obligation is to enjoy it.
 No reason to get emotionally involved.
 - Why not? - If you do, you'll be stuck eating the same damn cupcake for the rest of your life.
 But it was a really good cupcake.
 I can't stop thinking about it.
 Yeah, I've had cupcakes like that.
 The thing you gotta remember is there will always be other cupcakes.
 And if the day should come when you find yourself in a cupcake drought And those days come, don't kid yourself.
 well, then you just shell out a couple of bucks for a nice Ho Ho.
 - Understand? - I think so.
 Thanks, Uncle Charlie.
 No problem.
 - Hey, what are you guys talking about? - Sex.
 Well, how about that? The booger eater grasped the symbolism.
 - You were talking to my son about sex? - He came to me with a cupcake problem.
 I thought it was about sex.
 I was using cupcakes as a metaphor.
 Jeez, the kid got it.
 Okay, walk me through the metaphor.
 - Some little girl gave him a cupcake - Okay, stop.
 "Gave him a cupcake.
 " Are we talking baked goods or are we talking some new hip-hop slang? Baked goods.
 I told him it was okay to enjoy the cupcake without feeling emotionally obligated.
 So you told my son it's okay to have sex with a girl without having any feelings towards her? Lucky for us he asked me stuff I know about.
 There's no "us" here.
 There's no "lucky.
 " That's a terrible lesson.
 Hey, I could've done 20 minutes just on licking the icing.
 But I took the high road.
 Okay, okay, enough.
 Here's the deal.
 From now on, all cupcake conversations will be referred to me.
 Why? You don't know the difference between a Ding Dong and your elbow.
 Nevertheless, I do not want him learning about relationships from a misogynist.
 A misogynist? You're saying I'm a misogynist? Yes, Charlie.
 You are a misogynist.
 I'm a misogynist? I'm a misogynist? That is really low, Alan.
 Calling your own brother a misogynist.
 G- I-N or G-E-N? - G-Y-N.
 - Thanks.
 - I do not hate women.
 - Oh, come on, Charlie.
 If anything, I am the opposite of a misogynist.
 I'm a pro-sogynist.
 I love women.
 Oh, is that so? Even if there's no possibility of having sex with them? What? Exactly.
 And it is precisely that attitude I do not want my son to grow up with.
 Okay, okay.
 Hold it just a second.
 So you'd rather he grow up to be like you? Scared of women? Manipulated by women? - Hey, that's not true.
 - Oh, please.
 Look at your ex-wife.
 Say what you want about me, but I've never chosen women -  who do nothing but mistreat me.
 - Hey, stud.
 I don't know what kind of sick, twisted party you had the last couple days but I sure as hell ain't cleaning it up.
 That is different.
 Way different.
 - Hey, Dad, what time is it? - Twenty after 6.
 Why? Because I have to call my girlfriend at 6:30.
 - What girlfriend? - Robin Newberry.
 Cupcake Robin Newberry? - Charlie, stay out of it.
 - How can I stay out of it? If I saw a bus heading for him, would I not throw myself in front of it? - Would you? - I'm just making a point here.
 Charlie, if you don't mind, I'll handle it.
 Jake, I thought we talked about this.
 I shouldn't take a cupcake from a girl if I don't like her.
 - That's right.
 - So I decided to like her.
 We're exclusive.
 - Exclusive? - That means I don't talk to other girls and I get a cupcake every day.
 I'd better call now.
 If I'm late, she yells at me.
 Congratulations, Alan.
 Your son is officially pastry whipped.
 Marco.
 Not now, Rose.
 Marco.
 Rose, I'm not in the mood.
 Marco.
 Polo.
 - Hey, Charlie.
 - Hey.
 Something wrong? I'm not sure.
 Rose, do you think I'm a misogynist? Oh, wow, yeah.
 Why? Did somebody say you weren't? Marco.
 How can I be a misogynist? My whole life is a testament to my love for women.
 It's sweet that you think that but what you call love is really just an obsession to control and dominate based on mistrust and hostility.
 Yeah, so? You forget I spent the night with you once.
 You don't make love to a woman, you overpower her.
 You subjugate her.
 You ravage her.
 Anyhow, it's obvious you're still trying to resolve longstanding Oedipal issues.
 Hold on.
 O- E-D.
 - You sure? - Yeah, I have a Master's in psychology.
 And I know how to spell.
 "I have a Master's in psychology and I know how to spell.
 " Here it is: Oedipus complex.
 Okay, that's what I thought.
 It's just sick.
 Unconscious, unresolved sexual feelings towards my mother? I didn't write the dictionary, Charlie.
 But it's not true.
 I despise my mother.
 Consciously, yes.
 And that's why you conflate sex and aggression.
 It's textbook misogyny.
 Conflate? Come on.
 What is it, fancy word day? It means to join together.
 Thank you.
 So, what are you saying? You will never be able to have a trusting and truly loving relationship with any woman until you resolve your feelings about your mother.
 Broads have been telling me that for years.
 It's a lot of hooey.
 It's okay, Charlie.
 The world is filled with women who seek out misogynists.
 Women who need men to mistreat them and provide them with angry, aggressive sex in order to satisfy their own twisted pathology.
 I see.
 Well, I guess I'll just have to look for a woman like that.
 Marco.
 - Thanks for giving me another chance.
 - You were so darling, I couldn't resist.
 I know I've got some intimacy issues, but I'm working on them.
 And if you could just be patient with me I think you and I could truly conflate.
 What's "conflate" mean? Look, you don't have to go.
 Relax, Charlie.
 All men have performance problems occasionally.
 No, no, no.
 It's not officially a performance problem until we give up.
 Right now, it's just unusually long foreplay.
 Sorry, but I have to get back to work.
 Damn, my carpal tunnel's acting up.
 How about if I come with you? - We can give it a shot in your car.
 - It's okay.
 I still love you.
 Thank you.
 I mean, I really appreciate your understanding and support during this dark time.
 I'll call you.
 - What? - Nothing.
 Go ahead.
 Say it.
 I have nothing to say.
 Except, you know: Oh, my.
 Don't tell me I got a rise out of you.
 Alan, I am right on the edge.
 Be very careful.
 Sorry.
 I didn't realize it was so impotent.
 - You forget one thing.
 - Oh, what's that? I can still run.
 Yes? Mom, it's me, Charlie.
 I'm a little busy right now.
 What do you want? - We need to talk.
 - About what? How I'll never be able to have a meaningful relationship because of the way you screwed me up.
 Well sorry about that.
 - Let me in.
 - There's more? Yes.
 Will this having children thing never end? Mom.
 Look, I'm sorry this is such a major inconvenience for you, but Oh, God.
 - What are you doing? - Downward-Facing Dog.
 - What? - It's yoga, Charlie.
 Could your dog possibly face upward while we talk? Fine.
 Jeez.
 What the hell is the mutt doing now? Charlie, just say what you came to say.
 Okay, well, are you aware that I'm a misogynist? Really? I raised you Episcopalian.
 This isn't funny.
 My anger and mistrust towards women starts with you.
 Wasn't a problem till it spilled into my sex life.
 So you're blaming Mommy because Little Charlie can't come out and play? Okay, first of all, we don't call it "Little Charlie.
 " What do we call it, darling? We don't call it anything.
 Well, when you were a baby we called it Mr.
 Pinky.
 I may never have sex again.
 Oh, wait a sec.
 Mr.
 Pinky was the cat.
 - What did we call your penis? - It doesn't matter.
 The point is it isn't working anymore.
 And somehow it's all tied up in some sick, twisted knot with you.
 Mr.
 Pee-pee.
 That's it.
 Well, you can see why I confused that with Mr.
 Pinky.
 Mom, I learned about relationships from watching you.
 And you know what toxic little lessons I learned? - Tell me, sweetheart.
 - Men who get emotionally involved get stepped on.
 I learned that men who get married get emasculated.
 That the best way to not get your heart broken is to pretend you don't have one.
 - You learned all that from me? - Yes.
 Darling, I've never been more proud of you than I am at this moment.
 - You're joking, right? - Not at all.
 For the first time I look at you and I see myself.
 Oh, that's just insane.
 Save room for dessert.
 I bought brownies.
 No, thanks.
 Brownies just remind me of cupcakes.
 - His little girlfriend dumped him.
 - Really? She said she needed her space.
 - I'm sorry, buddy.
 - Want some advice? Yeah.
 What do I do, Uncle Charlie? I meant from me.
 No, thank you.
 - Well? - You might as well listen to your dad because I got nothing.
 Less than him? Fellas, I am the sick puppy of a downward dog.
 Only thing I'm good for is drinking out of the toilet and sniffing my own ass.
 Which, by the way, I saw our mother do earlier.
 Okay, what do you think? - Marco.
 - Oh, jeez.
 - Don't do that.
 - Sorry.
 - Are you okay? - Oh, sure.
 Everything I believed in is wrong.
 Everything I thought I was I'm not.
 And Mr.
 Pee-pee's on the fritz.
 - Mr.
 Pee-pee? - Yeah, it's what my mother used to - Don't make me explain this, Rose.
 - Okay.
 - But he's on the fritz, you say.
 - Yes.
 Well, I'm not surprised.
 The depth of your pathology coupled with your denial was bound to manifest itself physically sooner or later.
 In plain, simple English, Rose.
 When your mind gets crazy, Mr.
 Pee-pee gets lazy.
 I'll put it in another way.
 When your psyche gets iffy, you can't get a stiffy.
 Stop it.
 Stop it.
 Just tell me how I can fix it.
 Oh, there's no quick fix, when it comes to limp Rose.
 - No more rhymes.
 - You sure? I got a beauty with "toner.
 " Okay.
 Well, traditional therapy can help but you'll have to commit to a long, arduous process of self-exploration over a period of years.
 Years? I can't go years without Mr.
 Pee-pee.
 Charlie, isn't your long-term mental and emotional health more important than a few fleeting orgasms? It's not even more important than one.
 Well, in that case, I suppose we could try a shortcut like hypnotherapy.
 - You know how to do that? - I studied it.
 But for it to work, you'd have to trust me completely.
 You know, Rose, as strange as it may seem out of all the women I know, you're the only one I trust at all.
 Personally, I find that very flattering while professionally, it's deeply disturbing.
 Oh, well.
 So just relax, sit back, close your eyes and listen only to the sound of my voice.
 I wanna get my mother out of my head, okay? I don't wanna quit drinking, gambling or any good stuff.
 Got it.
 Okay.
 So just relax.
 Oh, my.
 I see everything's back to normal.
 Better than normal.
 - Did you take one of those pills? - I don't need any pills.
 It's all me.
 And nobody else.
 Why don't you relax while I introduce you to the new, improved Charlie? - Who were you calling? - I was just ordering a little chicken.
 What smells so good? Your kid's in the kitchen baking.
 - You're kidding.
 - Hey, Dad.
 Want a cupcake? Sure.
 Uncle Charlie? Thank you.
 Have as many as you want.
 I've got another batch in the oven.
 That's very tasty.
 What prompted this? I figured out I don't need a girlfriend.
 If I want a cupcake, I make it myself.
 Taking matters into his own hands.
 The metaphor is now complete.
 Anybody wanna lick the beater? - No.
 - No.
 What? SDl Media Group   






                    			That's a cool snake tattoo on your back.
 Thanks.
 That's Anacoth, the demon who eats human souls.
 My friend Jeffrey has a dog that eats its own poop.
 He tries to lick our face but we don't let him.
 - Okay.
 - Who's that one? That's the Goddess of the Damned.
 She whose name cannot be spoken.
 - Why, is it hard to pronounce? - What? We have a friend at school like that.
 He's from India.
 We just call him Rusty.
 No kidding.
 - Does it hurt to get tattoos? - Yeah.
 - But it's worth it, you know? - Sure.
 Once I bit my tongue really hard eating a frozen Milky Way but it was totally worth it.
 - Good morning.
 - Hey, Dad.
 - Hey.
 - Hi, I'm Alan, Jake's dad.
 - Isabella.
 - She's a friend of Uncle Charlie's.
 I would hope so.
 Yeah, and she was showing me her tattoos.
 Lucky you.
 There was a time you'd have to pay a quarter and go into a tent to see that.
 Now it's right at your breakfast table.
 - Go get dressed.
 - I wanna see the rest of her tattoos.
 - Go.
 - I have a quarter.
 Jake.
 All right.
 Isabella, I hate to be a fuddy-duddy but we keep the house smoke free.
 I'm sorry.
 Charlie didn't say anything when I was smoking in bed last night.
 Yeah, well, Charlie's lungs aren't always on the same page as his penis.
 - Morning, baby.
 - Hey.
 If you don't like it, don't watch.
 I'm gonna go upstairs and take a shower.
 You wanna join me? Sure.
 Just let me get some fluids in me so I got something to work with.
 Hurry.
 Anacoth is hungry.
 Anacoth is hungry? She's referring to her snake tattoo.
 Her vagina is called Linda.
 Pretty name.
 Listen, I don't wanna overstep my bounds.
 This is your house and you're free to bring into it whoever or whatever you choose.
 But I do think I have the right to protect Jake from being exposed to certain people.
 Well, you'd better take him to a hotel.
 Because that girl ain't leaving till one of us is dead.
 - Come on, Charlie.
 - No.
 No.
 You come on.
 You see a little body ink and cigarette and you immediately condemn her.
 She's smart, she's got a great sense of humor and in bed she moves like one of those paint shakers at Sherwin-Williams.
 Nevertheless, I would rather she didn't hang around Jake.
 Fine.
 I'll talk to her.
 - Thank you.
 - You're welcome.
 Now, unless you wanna lather up my fanny I'm gonna go hop in the shower with Anacoth and Linda.
 Isabella.
 I I didn't hear you come in.
 You weren't meant to.
 So you think I'm a bad influence on your kid? Well, gee, I wouldn't put it that way.
 But, you know, kids are impressionable.
 And the violent psychosexual imagery of your body art not to mention the smoking aren't something a young boy needs to Why are you taking my hair? Just a little quirk of mine.
 I used to collect stamps.
 You know, people like you have been persecuting people like me for thousands of years.
 Well, that's a bit hard to believe.
 Seeing as people like me have historically been victims and food.
 But just for clarity who exactly are the people like you? Those whose eyes are open to a greater reality than you could ever imagine.
 I see.
 And do they all collect hair? - Don't mock what you don't understand.
 - I'm sorry.
 I tend to resort to mocking when I'm totally creeped out.
 I don't like you.
 Yeah, well I'm rubber, you're glue.
 Something, something, something, you.
 So be it.
 So be it.
 So be it.
 Damn it.
 What the hell? I don't think so, Mom.
 First of all, I'm just not a big fan of costume parties.
 Yeah, Jake likes The Wizard of Oz.
 I don't think he'd enjoy hanging out with a bunch of drunken real-estate agents dressed like Judy Garland.
 Okay, I'll get him.
 Mom wants to ask you something.
 Hi, Mom.
 No.
 What happened to your face? Nothing, I just thought I'd put little blood-soaked pieces of toilet paper on it.
 What do you think? It suits you.
 - What's the deal with your eye? - I don't know.
 I think I'm getting a sty.
 Might be a bit much with the toilet paper.
 I'd go with one or the other.
 - Thank you for your input.
 - No problem.
 - Where you going? - Isabella's taking me to a party.
 She said it's gonna be out of control.
 Can you imagine what this girl considers to be out of control? Well, let's see.
 Biting the head off a live chicken? Vivisecting homeless people and playing Hacky Sack with their still-beating hearts? What are you talking about? Do you have any idea what Isabella is really into? So she's a little kinky.
 No, no, no.
 Kinky is a feather duster up your butt.
 I think this woman tried to put a curse on me.
 Oh, please.
 Who of us hasn't done that? To know you is to curse you.
 She took my hair.
 - She took your hair? - Y eah.
 Yeah.
 And then she laughed like: - Oh, well, that's different.
 - So you see my concern? Yes, I do.
 Good night.
 Where you going? To pick up a bottle of wine and a feather duster.
 You sure my Mercedes is okay parked on the street? I mean, I gave that crack whore $10 to watch it but now I'm thinking who's watching the crack whore? Don't worry about your car.
 Okay.
 So where are all the guys? How come I'm the only weenie in this pot of beans? - Because this party is in your honor.
 - Really? What did I do? You're a vessel of the masculine life force.
 You picked up on that? I tell people that all the time and they just get snotty.
 These women are all my sisters.
 They all want to please you.
 Well, gosh, that's swell.
 - Then you're okay with this? - It was my idea.
 Let me tell you something, Isabella, you are just tops in my book.
 This is very tasty.
 What'd you say this was? - A secret elixir.
 - Secret elixir, huh? I'm more of a bourbon guy but push comes to shove I don't know what the hell's in that either.
 Oh, boy.
 Getting a little fuzzy around the edges.
 Got any crackers? - He's ready.
 - You bet your gothic ass I am.
 - Where are we going? - T o the altar room.
 Oh, boy.
 What's the altar room? It's where we anoint you.
 Oh, boy.
 I'm getting anointed.
 Sounds nasty.
 - Anoint him.
 - Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 Anoint him.
 - Morning.
 - Morning.
 Great googly-mooglies.
 - What the hell happened to you? - I'm not sure.
 Looks like you got bit in the face by one of them Ebola monkeys.
 I don't think so, Berta.
 I mean, you weren't exactly eye-candy going in.
 But now: You could scare the flies off a manure truck.
 Thank you.
 Until you said that I was feeling a little self-conscious.
 - You know I'm razzing you, don't you? - Yeah.
 I mean, it's really not that Oh, sweet lord, I'm gonna lose my Eggos.
 Okay, if open-mike night in the burn ward is over I'm gonna make breakfast and get out before Charlie's new girlfriend gets up.
 Why, is she not as compassionate as me? She's just a very creepy woman.
 Well, putting aside the whole pot-kettle thing, creepy how? Well, she's got tattoos all over her.
 I've got tattoos.
 And she's got this very dark, hostile attitude.
 Okay, you might actually like her but I don't want to have anything to do with her.
 Good morning.
 Isabella.
 Hello.
 That's a nasty looking eye you've got there.
 It's just a sty.
 Right? What else would it be? Hey, Vampira tell Count Humpula to get out of bed so I can change his sheets.
 Charlie and I are spending the entire day in bed.
 We do not want to be disturbed.
 Do you understand? Is it getting cold in here? Do you understand? Yep.
 You betcha.
 Thank you.
 Bye, Alan.
 Take care of that eye.
 I will.
 Thank you.
 You see what I mean about? - What are you doing? - Leaving.
 - Why? - Did you see that bitch? You gotta put a whole lot of gone between you and a broad like that.
 - But wait a second - Goodbye and good luck.
 That is some sty.
 This is no sty.
 This is something else.
 Something evil.
 Something ugly.
 You know what? I'm starting to think your girlfriend did this.
 - Oh, come on.
 - Charlie, this isn't just about me.
 Have you taken a look at yourself recently? Oh, man.
 It's gonna take more than a little spray-on tan to fix that.
 Do you realize how long you've been upstairs with her? - That depends.
 - On what? On what day it is.
 It's Sunday evening.
 I haven't seen you since you went to that party.
 Oh, yeah, the party.
 - That was some great party.
 - What happened? I have no idea.
 Although, I did wake up with this.
 - Oh, my God.
 - Am I Jewish now? Charlie, that's not the Star of David, it's a pentagram.
 It's a satanic symbol used to call forth demons from hell.
 Oh, that's not good.
 - You need to cut Isabella loose.
 - I can't.
 Why not? Because together we shall spawn a child named Giglamesh.
 And he shall bring forth a new age of darkness.
 You know, maybe it's time to slow this relationship down a little bit.
 Slow it down? You need to drive a stake through its heart.
 - Is she still here? - Yeah.
 Okay, here's the plan.
 So we'll submit to her will and serve the Lord Beelzebub with all our hearts.
 I'll grab Jake.
 You start the car.
 We'll drive somewhere safe.
 I'm thinking the Vatican.
 - Don't be ridiculous.
 - What are you gonna do? - You said it.
 We have to cut her loose.
 - "We"? I didn't say "we.
 " I never said "we.
 " Hear us, oh, Horned One.
 Wrap your dark wings around this young soul and grant him all the rewards he desires.
 Okay, hi, Mr.
 Horned One.
 Here's the deal, I'll trade you my soul for What do I get, like, three wishes? He's the Lord of the Underworld, not a genie.
 Oh, okay.
 Can I talk to a genie? Jake, get over here.
 Sorry, Dad, but you're no longer my master.
 The hell I'm not.
 Go to your room.
 I'm old enough to choose my own religion.
 Go.
 How dare you interfere? Good question.
 Alan, tell her how we dare.
 Hey, you brought her here, you get her out.
 Are you trying to get rid of me? Okay, well, no, not you personally.
 This is more of a legal issue.
 It turns out Malibu is not zoned for satanic rituals.
 Or any of the black arts, really.
 Right, Alan? That's true.
 You're fine in Hollywood.
 Pretty much anywhere east of the 405 freeway, actually.
 - Shut up, Alan.
 - Just trying to help.
 Did you really think that you can end this? I was kind of hoping.
 Don't you realize that our souls are now bound together destined to writhe ecstatically in blessed hellfire for all eternity? Boy, I know how to pick them, don't I? Charlie, do you remember the vows you took last night? - Vows? - You took vows? What kind of vows? If you'll shut up, maybe we'll find out.
 You vowed unending fealty to the sisterhood of the coven.
 You did that? Why would you do that? Will you please shut up? I did that? Why would I do that? Did you think those beautiful women were pleasuring you because of your boyish charm? Well.
 No, not all of them.
 I just figured after the first three or four, word of mouth started to spread.
 Wait, wait, how many women are we talking about here? I don't know.
 Nine, 10 Thirteen.
 The sacred number.
 And a personal best for me.
 How do you have sex with 13 women at one time? Well, apparently, you have to take some vows.
 Okay, okay, listen.
 Thank the girls for me, tell them I had a wonderful time but tell them I have to pass on the fealty stuff.
 I have a previous commitment to, you know, God.
 It doesn't work that way, Charlie.
 If you break your vows you bring down upon yourself the ancient curse of betrayal.
 - Well, that's the chance I'll have to take.
 - So be it.
 So be it.
 Just kidding.
 Simply out of curiosity, what exactly is this curse? What should I be on the lookout for? - Your crops will wither in the field.
 - Yeah, okay.
 Your cattle will sicken and die.
 Your manhood will shrivel and become a useless husk.
 I gotta fold here, Alan.
 Okay, you got me.
 What do you say we call the girls over and start spawning baby Giglamesh? - Don't do this.
 - Hey, when she's shriveling your husk then you get a vote.
 Go ahead, call the coven.
 Wow, you gals could make a fortune delivering pizzas.
 Mom? Boo, everybody.
 Now, not a word, Charlie.
 You're all coming with me to my costume party and I'm not taking no for an answer.
 Evelyn? Isabella.
 You know each other? In a manner of speaking.
 - What are you doing here? - Nothing.
 These are my sons.
 It was an accident.
 I had no idea.
 Please, believe me.
 Goodbye, Isabella.
 Yes, goodbye.
 - Bye, Charlie.
 - Hold on, hold on.
 What about the vows, the curse and the shriveling? I have no idea what he's talking about.
 What? She's in my Pilates class.
 - I'll buy that.
 - Okay.
 Now, are you coming to my party or you gonna give me a hard time? - I'm coming to the party.
 - Me too.
 Jake, come get your costume.
 - What's Mom gonna wear? - Shut up.
 Let's go.
 Grand-mommy doesn't want to be late to her costume party.
 Oh, come on, boys.
 Sell it.
 Very nice.
 Now fly, my pets, fly.
 I call shotgun.

                    			Oh, this is gonna be so great.
 Are you guys as excited as I am? Probably not.
 Okay.
 Oh, you have got to be kidding me.
 You guys are the best.
 Is this a chocolate fudge cake? You tell us, you brought it.
 Make a wish and blow out the candles.
 Oh, right, right.
 I wish this was chocolate fudge.
 Okay, now it's time for party games.
 I've got one.
 It's called Drink Until This Night Makes Some Sort of Sense.
 I'll go first.
 Nope, not yet.
 Round two.
 Uncle Charlie? Go away.
 Have you seen my iPod? No.
 What about you, Rose? No.
 Sorry, Jake.
 Oh, man.
 Good morning, sleepyhead.
 Morning.
 So.
 What's new? That's good coffee.
 - Good morning.
 - It's getting there.
 - Whose birthday cake? - Rose.
 Oh, surprise party? No, I think she saw it coming.
 - Morning.
 - Morning.
 Hey.
 Coffee? Can you make it to go? T o go? Yeah, the thing is, I made a little boo-boo.
 - A boo-boo? - A boo-boo.
 Anyway, I may have to leave town for a few days.
 Why? What did you do? Rose.
 What? I did Rose.
 Wait.
 You had sex with Rose? Are you insane? Moot point, Alan.
 What I have to do is find my passport and head for the border.
 What you have to do is tell Rose that I was drunk and I'm sorry and that there's no reason to hunt me down and glue my testicles to my thigh.
 Again.
 I'll tell you now, you're swabbing on your own nail polish remover this time.
 That wasn't pleasant for either of us, Berta.
 - What the hell were you thinking? - Thinking? There was no thinking.
 We had tequila shots, were talking, having a nice evening and somebody suggested a sponge bath.
 - Somebody? - It might have been me.
 The next thing I know, Jake is waking us up looking for his iPod.
 Wait, Jake saw you in bed with Rose? No.
 Oh, great, great.
 That's great.
 - What am I gonna tell him? - Who cares? He's 11.
 He'll get over it.
 I'm the one who still has a bald patch on my scrotum.
 And let me tell you, the comb-over isn't fooling anybody.
 - Morning.
 - Oh, hey, look, it's Rose.
 - Morning, Rose.
 - Hey, birthday girl.
 You get anything good last night? It was a wonderful party.
 Isn't that nice.
 Can I get you anything? Coffee, orange juice, industrial strength adhesive? No, I can't stay.
 I'm having a birthday lunch with my dad.
 Well, that's great.
 Not that I'm anxious for you to leave.
 It's great you're gonna spend time with dad.
 Dads are great.
 I like the word "dad" better than "father.
 " If Hitler had called Germany dadland instead of fatherland it would have been a friendlier country.
 - Charlie.
 - Y es? - You're acting crazy.
 - Am I? Hey, if anybody knows.
 I understand last night was just one of those things.
 I have no expectations.
 Okay.
 Good.
 - And? - And nothing.
 I'll see you later.
 - Bye, guys.
 - Bye.
 Oh, God, it's worse than I thought.
 What are you talking about? She sounded fine.
 Berta, tell him.
 She's nuts, he's screwed.
 - Uncle Charlie? - Yeah, buddy? You know what would be cool? If you and Rose got married.
 Yeah, Charlie, that would be cool.
 I could be the best man.
 Carry the ring for you and the medication for her.
 Do pharmacies have bridal registries? Hey, have you guys talked about having kids? Are we gonna hear the pitter-patter of teeny-weeny, crazy-ass feet? No, he's not gonna marry Rose.
 Why not? He's already getting sex from her.
 Jake.
 Jake, the only reason Rose was in my bed is because she was too tired to go home.
 Uncle Charlie, I'm an underachiever, not an idiot.
 Okay, fine.
 You want the truth? - Charlie, be discreet.
 - Because a man and woman have sex doesn't mean they get married or they see each other.
 It doesn't even mean they have to give their actual names.
 Thank you for your discretion.
 No, no.
 It's time somebody taught him the facts of life.
 What facts? That you did a stupid thing because you're a stupid man? I was getting to that.
 Why was it stupid? Because he had sex with someone he doesn't love.
 No, no.
 Because I had sex with someone who knows how to disable the alarm system.
 And who has no compunction about shaving my head while I sleep.
 - What's a compunction? - Go get ready for bed.
 Sounds dirty.
 Just go.
 Hey, lady, I can see your compunction.
 - Charlie, do me a favor? - What? - Don't talk to my kid about sex.
 - Why? Because you're a pig.
 Okay.
 - What was that? - What was what? It was a thump.
 - What do you mean a thump? - You know, a thump.
 Like a woman dressed as a ninja jumping from a tree and landing on the roof with cat-like precision.
 - I didn't hear anything.
 - Well, I did.
 I guess your hearing's more acute when your nuts are on the line.
 Come on, you don't really think Rose is gonna do anything? Hey, I never told you half the weird stuff she pulled here.
 - Why not? - We needed a babysitter and I didn't want you to get spooked.
 Okay, I'm listening.
 One time she trained a seagull to swoop down Oh, God, this is it.
 Come on.
 I can not believe a grown man like you is afraid of a little girl.
 A little girl with a big seagull.
 Went right for my eyes.
 You ever seen one of them swoop down on a picnic table to grab a french fry? - It was just like that.
 - Charlie.
 That's how she trained it.
 Took a picture of me and put french fries all over it.
 You're being ridiculous.
 Am I? We'll see.
 - Are you Charlie Harper? - Yes, I am.
 I'm Rose's father.
 I don't see a way out of this, do you? So you're Rose's dad.
 I can see the resemblance.
 You and I need to talk.
 Okay, sure, if you want.
 I'm booked for the next few days, but maybe we can next week.
 - Now.
 - Or now.
 There's a window in my schedule.
 Come on in.
 Thank you.
 - Can I get you something to drink? - I'm fine.
 You don't mind if I have a conversation starter, do you? - Knock yourself out.
 - I'm gonna try.
 - So I'm Charlie's brother, Alan.
 - Nice to meet you.
 Same here.
 I never slept with your daughter.
 I'm not surprised.
 Okay.
 Rose's dad.
 - Call me Harvey.
 - Okay, Harvey.
 Easy.
 Like the invisible rabbit in that Jimmy Stewart movie.
 - What was that called? - Harvey.
 Right.
 Loved that movie.
 People don't know it was originally a play.
 Then they tried to make it a musical.
 - Charlie? - Y es, sir? - Sit down.
 - Y es, sir.
 Now what are your intentions towards my daughter? Oh, right to the chase.
 Straight shooter.
 I like that.
 Thirsty.
 So where were we? He wants to know what your intentions are towards Rose.
 Thank you.
 Well, I would have to say that my intentions are good.
 Anybody who knows me would confirm that "Charlie Harper has good intentions.
 " His actions, on the other hand, are usually selfish and asinine.
 Again, thank you.
 Harvey, I'm glad we had this chance to talk - Sit down.
 - Sorry.
 - You gonna marry my daughter or not? - Not.
 - Not? - A very well-intended not.
 So after two years together, you just plan to keep on stringing her along? No, I would never Wait a minute, did you say two years? Now look, Rose cares very much about you and she's not gonna leave you.
 So I think the honorable thing for you to do is let her go.
 Believe me, Harvey, I've tried.
 God, how I've tried.
 So, what's the problem? You love her too much? Not exactly.
 I mean, she's a wonderful gal and I do care for her.
 But you see What, the peanut gallery taking a break? Harvey, the truth is, Charlie has tried to end it.
 But your daughter doesn't handle rejection well.
 Or all that legally.
 In my defense, we're not talking about a long-term relationship.
 We're talking about a couple of nights of drunken, frenzied sex two years apart.
 - That's your defense? - I didn't say it was a good defense.
 You'll have to forgive my brother.
 He thinks with his penis and his penis isn't very bright.
 That's true.
 Anybody who knows me will confirm that.
 I can confirm that.
 Oh, for God sake.
 Rose, did you tell your father we've been going out for two years? Yeah.
 I thought it sounded better than saying we had a one-night stand and then I stalked you for two years.
 She's not wrong.
 Daddy, try to understand.
 I didn't want you to feel sorry for me or try to set me up with anybody.
 Or have me committed.
 Oh, sweetheart, I would never do that.
 We're a wealthy family.
 We can afford home care.
 Okay, well, I'm glad we had this chance to clear the air.
 I'm sure you two have a lot to talk about so I'll let you get to it.
 - Mom? - Hang on, dear.
 - Hello? - Alan.
 Oh, good, I'm glad you're home.
 Listen, I'm in the neighborhood and I know how Charlie hates it when I just drop in unannounced, so I thought I'd call first.
 I'll let him know.
 Charlie, Mom's coming over.
 Tell her I'm not here.
 Hi, sweetie.
 Oh, hello, Rose.
 Hi, Evelyn.
 Daddy, this is Charlie's mom, Evelyn.
 - Evelyn, this is my father, Harvey.
 - Harvey, nice to meet you.
 Nice to meet you.
 So, what are we talking about? Well, Charlie and I got hammered last night and then somebody suggested a sponge bath.
 It might have been me.
 Then we ended up spending the night together.
 I see.
 Are you as proud of yours as I am of mine? You do the best you can to raise them but in the end they drive down life's highway on their own.
 Isn't that the truth? I think God gives us children so death won't come as such a disappointment.
 So, Evelyn are you married? Not at the moment.
 Why? What do you have in mind? Well, maybe we could start with a little dinner.
 Sounds good.
 But how do you wanna finish? Simultaneously.
 Oh, he's good.
 Hello.
 Oh, hi, Mom.
 - Hold on.
 Alan? - Yeah? Get the door.
 Boys, we have a problem.
 We need to talk.
 - What's going on? - We haven't seen you in days.
 - Not that we're complaining.
 - Merely an observation.
 Well, as you know, I have been seeing Rose's father.
 - And how's that going? - At first it was wonderful.
 He was handsome, charming, and a raging bull in the sack.
 No mental pictures.
 Push them out.
 Well, don't give them to me.
 What I didn't realize is the man has the emotional stability of a bag of rats in a burning meth lab.
 - What did he do? - It's what he didn't do.
 - Okay, what didn't he do? - Leave.
 Now, a couple of days of Viagra-enhanced boinking and he suddenly thinks he lives with me.
 He's moving my furniture around, he's getting his mail forwarded he had a satellite dish installed.
 Did he get the NFL package? Charlie, please, this is not funny.
 This man is obsessed with me.
 He will not let me out of his sight.
 Wherever I go, there he is with this stupid love-smitten look on his face.
 You just wanna hit him with a shovel.
 Well, what do you want us to do? Come over to my house and hit him with a shovel.
 Wouldn't it be easier to keep feeding him Viagra until he strokes? Charlie, don't be ridiculous.
 That could take months.
 Come on now, guys, think.
 How can I get this loon out of my house? - I say we bring in expert help.
 - Way ahead of you.
 Rose.
 - Yes, Charlie? - Road trip.
 Oh, goody, I'll meet you in the garage.
 - Daddy? - Oh, Rose, good.
 You got my change-of-address card.
 And there's my other favorite gal.
 - Hello, Harvey.
 - Where were you, pudding pop? I was worried sick.
 - I just went out.
 - I didn't see you leave.
 That's because I climbed out the laundry room window.
 Aren't you a limber little minx.
 Daddy, we need to talk.
 Yes, right away, honey.
 Hey, fellas, are you ready for some football? Evie, why don't you get our guests some cold drinks? Yes, of course, dear.
 Garden shed.
 Shovel.
 Bag of lime.
 - Daddy, listen to me very closely.
 - Okay.
 You don't live here.
 Yes, I do.
 Look at me.
 We've been through this before, remember? The pretty receptionist at your psychiatrist's office? Oh, yeah.
 Cheryl.
 She had a mean lawyer.
 But this is different.
 Evelyn and I are in love, we're gonna get married.
 Isn't that right? Not if you were the last crazy man on Earth.
 Guys, feel free to call me Dad.
 - No, thank you.
 - I couldn't.
 Daddy, pay attention.
 Okay.
 I know what it feels like to be so in love with someone you wanna crawl inside so that you're wearing their skin like a leotard with nipples.
 What I've learned is that not everyone is ready for that kind of intimacy.
 Take me and Charlie for example.
 We slept together two years ago realized we were better as friends, and haven't done it again since.
 - We haven't? - You were too drunk.
 I was gonna tell you eventually.
 Then why did you let me think we did? Because it doesn't make any difference.
 I'm in this for the long haul.
 Sweetheart, when Evie and I get married Charlie will be your stepbrother.
 Oh, I didn't think of that.
 Oh, trs kinky.
 Rose, stick with the plan.
 Okay.
 Daddy, I didn't wanna have to do this but I brought someone else here to talk to you.
 - Who? - Come on in, Grandma.
 You brought Mother? Harvey, how many times have I told you not to leave the estate without telling me? - Mom.
 - Playtime's over.
 - Get in the car, we're going home.
 - But, Mom, we're getting married.
 To this trash? I don't think so.
 Excuse me? Roll with it, Mom.
 I'm counting to three, Harvey.
 One, two I'm going, I'm - Keep the robe.
 - Thanks.
 I'm not wearing pants.
 Harvey, do you want me to put you over my knee? All right, I'm going.
 He's really a good boy.
 But these things happen when you marry a first cousin.
 I'd say they're lucky to have thumbs.
 I'm really sorry to impose on you.
 I just feel very uncomfortable being home alone tonight.
 - No problem, you sleep in my room.
 - Where will you sleep? I don't know, I'll find somebody.
 - I'm beat.
 I'm gonna go to bed.
 - Good night.
 - Good night, sweetheart.
 - Good night, Mom.
 Sleep tight, pudding pop.

                    			Thank you.
 Oh, I knew it.
 There's no extra foam in my latte.
 You ask for extra foam you might as well be asking for a piggyback ride, know what I mean? Charlie? Charlie? Oh, of course.
 Man's got a heat-seeking missile in his pants.
 Is it too much to ask that when we go out for coffee you stay within earshot, so I'm not talking to myself like a crazy person? And again, I'm talking to myself like a crazy person.
 Look.
 Yes, I see.
 Girl pretty.
 Charlie like.
 No, girl magnificent.
 Charlie buy her Lexus.
 I thought we were gonna hang out together but obviously your neurotic need for sex is more important than spending time with your only brother who despite everything continues to love you and is, by the way your best hope for a viable kidney transplant.
 You can get yourself home, right? What makes you think that she's even available? Maybe she's married, maybe she's gay, maybe she's a guy.
 Hey, I don't see a ring, a girlfriend or a bulge.
 If you'll excuse me, it's time to do that voodoo that I do do so well.
 Hi.
 - I'm Charlie.
 - Don't care.
 - And you are? - Not interested.
 How do you know? I know.
 Okay then.
 You think it's over? Because it's not over.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 I guess I was mislead by her complete and utter indifference to you.
 Yeah, well, watch and learn.
 - So - Go away.
 How about now? Is it over now? It's not an exact science, Alan.
 Look, if you knew me at all and shut me down, that would be one thing but to be dismissed on a simple hello, well, that's a tough pill to swallow.
 Would you rather I give it to you in a suppository? - Well, to be perfectly honest - Goodbye.
 - Hey, hey, did you hear that? - What? It's a It's a fat lady and she's singing.
 - You'd give up right now, wouldn't you? - Charlie, Elvis has left the building.
 I think giving up is a little moot at this point.
 Well, that attitude is why you sleep alone with a copy of Monster Boobs magazine under your pillow.
 Stay out of my room.
 Waverly Dance Studio, Got it.
 Westwood Academy of Dance, What's going on? I'm mapping out all the dance studios -  within a five-mile radius.
 - Why? I can't stop thinking about that girl I met.
 I have to find her.
 Shame you can't let your penis sniff a piece of her clothing.
 Look, I know her name, Mia.
 It was written on her coffee cup.
 I know she's a dancer.
 She was wearing leg-warmer-thingies and reading a dance magazine.
 Reading a dance magazine doesn't make you a dancer.
 Why not? You're a monster boob.
 Will you both stay out of my room.
 Tell me, why do you want to go to all this trouble to track down a girl who showed less than no interest in you? A girl who seemed actually repulsed by your very being.
 A girl whose skin visibly crawled at your mere proximity.
 Yeah, but did you see her butt? It was like a ripe little peach.
 That's your answer? Her ass reminded you of fruit? Berta, explain it to him.
 A lot of the times a peach will have a subtle cleft in it -  that is reminiscent of a woman's - No.
 Thanks.
 Thanks, I got the picture.
 Alan, do you know why Sir Edmund Hillary wanted to scale Mount Everest? Because it reminded him of a big pointy melon? That's part of the reason, but the main reason was he wanted to do it because everyone thought it was impossible.
 I'm missing the connection here.
 If a girl like Mia were easy to climb her head would be covered with flags.
 - So you're looking for a challenge.
 - Exactly.
 No one takes a picture of the fish that jumps on your boat.
 I I'm confused.
 Is she a mountain or a fish? Doesn't matter, either way I'm gonna scale her.
 And you, why do you enable this behavior? Why? I'll tell you why.
 Because your brother is the embodiment of the roll-up-your-sleeves spirit that made this country great.
 He never gets discouraged, he goes after what he wants and he doesn't know the meaning of quit.
 If the day should come when any man, no matter how humble can't go out there and soil the loins of some hot little dancer well, I don't wanna live in that America.
 Okay, very good.
 Now reverse.
 Oh, leave me alone.
 Keep going.
 Hey, you're a teacher.
 Hey, you're a stalker.
 No, no.
 I was passing by and happened to look in the window.
 What's the map for? Oh, this? I had to go to eight other dance studios before I found the right window.
 I suppose that could be interpreted as stalking but it could be just as easily be seen as sincerity, persistence Mental illness? Come on, I'm clearly smitten.
 Throw me a bone.
 - Charlie - You remembered my name.
 I wrote it down in case I needed to call the cops.
 I don't have time for dating right now.
 I'm completely focused on my work.
 Well, let's talk about work.
 I've always wanted to learn to dance -  can you teach me? - I only teach children.
 You don't have a class full of large, slow kids I could be part of? All right, how about this.
 My nephew loves to dance.
 A gifted little boy.
 Moves like a gazelle.
 - How old is he? - I don't know, 11, 12.
 It's hard to say, he's got a big head.
 Frankly I'd love to have a boy in the class.
 It's hard to get males excited about ballet.
 Jake is just ballet this and ballet that.
 Yeah, I'm sure.
 Why don't you bring him by tomorrow? - Great.
 Maybe afterwards you and I - Charlie, listen carefully.
 You and I, never gonna happen.
 Understood.
 See you tomorrow.
 Charlie to base camp, I am beginning my ascent.
 How you liking the pizza your old Uncle Charlie bought for his buddy? It's good.
 Save room, I've got a half-gallon of that fudge brownie ice cream.
 I don't know, I'm pretty stuffed.
 - You sure? - Maybe after I poop.
 What are you doing? - We're eating dinner.
 - He had dinner an hour ago.
 - Well, then he won't need breakfast.
 - Yes, I will.
 You've had enough to eat.
 Hey, Jake, you know what I like to do after a nice big meal? - What? - Learn to dance.
 - Charlie.
 - Yeah? Private word.
 Sure.
 - What's up? - Shame on you.
 Is that it? You found that girl and now you have a plan to use my son as bait.
 Yeah, so? It's not like he pays rent.
 Why shouldn't he pitch in a little? I will not allow it.
 Come on, it's just a couple of ballet lessons.
 Ballet? Him? I think he has a quiet grace about him.
 He doesn't have to be good, he just has to show up.
 One lesson, I'm begging you.
 You know what, it really doesn't matter what I say.
 You will never convince him to take ballet.
 If I can, will you stay out of it? - I guess.
 - Great.
 Hey, Jake.
 Okay, that might have been bad parenting on my part.
 I've got a surprise for you.
 It's not more food, is it? Because I'm starting to feel a little dizzy.
 You're gonna get to do something that no other boy in your class has done.
 If it's sex, Mitchell Fineman already saw his cousin naked.
 - No, this is better than sex.
 - What? How would he know? - You're gonna learn to dance ballet.
 - Wanna bet? Okay, let me put it this way.
 How much money would I have to give you to take ballet lessons? - I want $10.
 - Wait, hold on.
 I want $1000.
 That's really unethical.
 Oh, yeah, I'm the one on shaky moral ground.
 - Okay, I'll give you $500.
 - Split the difference.
 - Two-fifty.
 - Done.
 Come on, let's go.
 I changed my mind.
 You took my money.
 I'll give it back.
 Jake, we're here.
 You may as well give it a try.
 Yeah, give it a try.
 Who knows, you might like it.
 I will never forgive you for this.
 You didn't tell me I'd be the only boy here.
 So? The odds are on your side.
 The odds for what? I'm 11.
 - I wanna go home.
 - I thought we had a deal.
 You can't make him stay if he doesn't want to.
 I love you, Dad.
 All right, let's get started.
 - Who's that? - Your teacher.
 - Come on, let's go.
 - Hang on, Dad.
 Maybe we should give this a chance.
 Hi, I'm Jake.
 - Hi, Jake.
 It's nice to meet you.
 - Yeah.
 - Your uncle tells me you like ballet.
 - Yeah.
 Okay.
 How about you line up with the girls -  and we'll get started.
 - Yeah.
 How about that? He's got a crush.
 It's like watching a dog chase a car.
 He'll never catch it, and even if he did, he couldn't drive it.
 He's still doing better than you.
 Everyone, I'd like you to meet our new student Jake.
 - Hi, Jake.
 - Yeah, hi.
 Okay, let's start in first position.
 Jake, do you know first position? Is that like the missionary position? And one, and two and three, and four.
 I will never forgive you for this.
 What? He's having a great time.
 The clueless knucklehead.
 Okay, very nice, class.
 Yeah, good hustle, everybody.
 Much better, Jake.
 - That's because I have a good teacher.
 - Thank you.
 All right, that's it for this week.
 Remember, life is a dance, live it gracefully.
 That's my motto.
 Well, that settles it.
 I wanna be a ballet dancer when I grow up.
 Really? There's a load off my mind.
 It's not as easy as it looks.
 It's pretty hard.
 Yeah.
 It's pretty hard to watch.
 Thanks.
 Did you see how far Mia could put her leg over her head? I did notice that, yes.
 So, what do you think, Fred Astaire or Fred Flintstone? - He's got a lot of enthusiasm.
 - He gets that from me.
 I thought you were his uncle.
 That's the whole nature and nurture debate, isn't it? - So listen, Mia - I'm not going out with you.
 I know, you made it very clear.
 My question was is there anything more we can do to help Jake? Extra classes? Private tutoring? The three of us in Cabo for a long weekend? If he comes to class regularly, I think you'll be amazed at his progress.
 Good, I'd hate to think he's peaked.
 We're having a recital next month and with a lot of work and a little luck, we can include him.
 Charlie to base camp pretty cold up here, visibility zero.
 Call me.
 Okay.
 I hope you like this.
 It's an impertinent little cabernet with oaky overtones and just the hint of a floral finish.
 - Wow, you really know your wines.
 - I just read it off the box.
 What's the plan? Get me drunk and take advantage of me? Oh, good, you've done this before.
 I had a very nice time tonight.
 Was it worth all the trouble I put you through? You tell me.
 Ask me again in the morning.
 Charlie to base camp.
 I can see the summit.
 - Hey.
 - Hey, Jake.
 - What are you doing up? - Why shouldn't I be up? Isn't it past your bedtime? I don't know what you're talking about.
 - I don't have a bedtime.
 - Okay.
 - So, what's going on? - Not too much.
 Where's your dad? I don't know, why don't you go look for him? Look, Jake, Mia and I are kind of busy right now.
 - Busy doing what? - Talking.
 Okay.
 What are we talking about? We are not talking about anything.
 You're going to bed.
 Why don't we let Mia decide? Jake, I think you should go to bed.
 Are you sure? You don't have to decide right now.
 Your uncle and I would like to spend some alone-time together.
 All right.
 You want me to tuck you in? I'm too old to get tucked in, you You ass-face.
 Okay, then, sleep tight, little camper.
 Kids, huh? Yeah, kids.
 He never called me an ass-face before.
 - I think he's a little jealous.
 - Yeah.
 I remember feeling like that -  when I was his age.
 - Really? Cafeteria lady.
 Looked like Valerie Bertinelli but, you know, with a hairnet and just the cutest whisper of a mustache.
 She didn't know I was alive.
 You poor thing.
 I'm sorry, Mia.
 I can't I can't do this to him.
 Do what to him? One afternoon I saw the cafeteria lady holding hands with the shop teacher in the parking lot and it just killed me.
 Mr.
 Dinapoli.
 I'll never forget it.
 She was holding the hand with the missing thumb.
 You know what, I've gotta take you home.
 - I understand.
 - You do? You love Jake.
 You'd rather give up spending the night with me than risk hurting him.
 Right.
 Although when you spell it out like that, it sounds incredibly stupid.
 You're a very sweet man.
 Thank you.
 I was kidding.
 Let's go upstairs.
 Charlie, take me home.
 Let's talk about this.
 He's 11, he'll get over it.
 I got over one-thumb Dinapoli.
 You asleep? - You can quit faking, I took her home.
 - Really? - Yeah.
 - How come? It's part of the guy code.
 When two friends like the same girl, one of them has to step aside.
 Unless she's a good sport, then it's like Saturday morning at the bakery.
 It's a complicated code.
 Don't worry about it.
 Bottom line is, I'm out of the Mia business.
 Cool.
 Now, go to sleep.
 - Uncle Charlie? - Yeah? I'm sorry I called you an ass-face.
 Oh, yeah.
 I forgot about that.
 No woman is worth this.
 I am so proud.
 Our little boy is growing up.

                    			- Jake? - Yeah? - Are you praying? - It's okay.
 I'm not in school.
 No, no, it's fine.
 What are you praying for? I have a math test on Monday.
 Oh, so you're praying for a good grade? No, that never works.
 I'm praying for the teacher to get sick.
 Have you considered just studying for the test? How would that help? Okay, listen to me.
 Even if we were to assume a God who would be willing -  to give your teacher a cold - Anthrax.
 - All right, that's it.
 No more praying.
 - What are you, the Supreme Court? How do you know about the Supreme Court? This guy on TV, Reverend Don.
 He talks to God.
 He said you should pray to strike down your teacher? No, activist judges.
 But I figured why can't it work on Ms.
 Stanley? You know what else, If I send Reverend Don money God will make me rich.
 And did you send him money? Wouldn't you? No.
 God doesn't make people rich.
 And even if he did, it wouldn't make you happy.
 Well, I disagree.
 Jake.
 Reward without effort is meaningless.
 Money alone will not give you fulfillment.
 What about Uncle Charlie? He seems fulfilled and he doesn't do anything.
 Hey, hey, let me tell you about your Uncle Charlie.
 He puts on a happy face, but on the inside he is a sad, lonely man.
 You see? I'm about to do a load of laundry.
 Last chance to change your underwear.
 I'm good.
 Hold off on the washing machine.
 I think Charlie and his friend are still in the shower.
 I'll check.
 You were right.
 I wouldn't wait for me to get that.
 - Hello.
 - Hello.
 We haven't met.
 I'm Norma Seabury from next door.
 Oh, it's nice to finally meet you.
 I'm Alan Harper.
 Harper? Are you related to that dreadful Charlie? My mother says I am, but frankly, I have my doubts I'm related to her.
 Well, Alan, there's a little red sports car blocking my driveway.
 I assume it belongs to one of your brother's whores.
 - One of his what? - Whores.
 Ever since he moved in here, it's been one endless parade of whores.
 Oh, whores.
 Well, in all fairness most of them don't have the math skills to be whores.
 Be that as it may, I'm late for my hair appointment and I want that car moved immediately.
 Absolutely.
 I am so sorry.
 Let me track down the whore in question and ask her to move it.
 Thank you.
 - God bless you.
 - He'd better, I sent in 5 bucks.
 Charlie, we have a situation.
 Okay, that looks pretty clean.
 Now do me.
 This is so unfair.
 Excuse me.
 Not now, Alan.
 I'm making bubbles.
 I don't care what her name is.
 Her car is blocking our neighbor's driveway.
 Oh, sorry, I'll move it.
 You can't go now, you're busy.
 Oh, yeah.
 I'm busy.
 All right, just tell me where the keys are and I'll move it.
 Oh, gosh, no.
 I don't let strange men touch my car.
 Oh, good, at least you have respect for your car.
 Alan, do we need to have another boundaries talk? No, I'm leaving.
 Look what's dirty again.
 Okay, I have located the owner of the sports car.
 Is she going to pull it out? Not for a while.
 Well, how am I supposed to get to my hair appointment? Well, gee, I'd say that you really don't need one.
 I mean, I think your hair looks lovely as it is.
 Well, aren't you sweet? Are you homosexual? No, just sweet.
 You don't have to miss your appointment.
 I'll drive you.
 - You would do that for me? - It'd be my pleasure.
 Sure you're not homosexual? Positive.
 You would have made a good one.
 - Going home already? - No, I'm going to the opera.
 They can't end it until I sing.
 There's no call for sarcasm.
 No.
 - What's up? - What is that old witch doing here? Old witch? She's She's a charming woman.
 Of course she's charming.
 They all are.
 That's how they lure you into their houses made of gingerbread.
 What exactly is the deal between you? - Why do you hate her? - Why don't ask her why she hates me.
 She told me you're a horrible neighbor who doesn't care about anyone.
 There you go.
 How can I like somebody who talks about me like that? Hello, Mr.
 Harper.
 Hey, Norma.
 Eat any little kids lately? I could ask you the same thing.
 Oh, and by the way will she be moving her car out of my driveway any time soon? Maybe people wouldn't park in your driveway if you didn't put your trash in my guest parking spot.
 You don't have a guest parking spot.
 There's no such thing as a guest parking spot.
 It's called a curb and it belongs to the city of Malibu.
 Hey, if I can pass out on it, I figure it's mine.
 Well, by that logic, I I guess you own my doghouse too.
 That only happened once and Bruno was fine with it.
 Alan thank you so much for a wonderful day.
 I'm looking forward to next Saturday.
 Oh, me too.
 And as for you, Mr.
 Harper Bruno never had fleas before that night.
 You passed out in her doghouse? Hey, I've passed out in wheelbarrows, but this isn't about me.
 - Oh, really? Who is it about? - You.
 Why are you dating a woman who lost her virginity during World War ll? And knowing her, probably not to one of our guys.
 First of all, we are not dating.
 I'm escorting her to a charity event.
 Second of all, her age is irrelevant.
 The only thing that matters is what's inside.
 The only thing inside her is dust and undigested mastodon meat.
 She's isn't that old, Charlie.
 Come on, I bet she was an eyewitness -  to the birth of agriculture.
 - Stop it.
 Her high school graduation picture's probably on a cave wall in France.
 Are you done? Her prom theme was "Fire".
 Charlie, I can't figure out how to turn off the shower.
 There's so many knobs.
 That's okay.
 Just dry off and I'll take care of it.
 Thanks.
 How does it feel dating a woman whose IQ is the same as her age? I could ask you the same thing.
 Oh, here's something else we have in common.
 Both our girls are pruney but mine's gonna plump back up in a little while.
 Well, thank you for a lovely evening.
 Oh, no, thank you for taking me.
 I so loathe going to these things by myself.
 And dancing.
 I can't remember the last time I danced.
 That was fun.
 One more spin? Okay, sure.
 Thank you for being so kind to a lonely old gal.
 Stop saying that.
 You are not old.
 You're a vibrant fascinating woman.
 - I had a great time with you tonight.
 - Likewise.
 And I want you to give some serious thought to my offer.
 I will, I will.
 Okay, so So good night.
 Good night.
 All right.
 - Morning.
 - Morning.
 Who sent the flowers? I'll give you a hint.
 - Wait until you see the card.
 - You read the card? I couldn't.
 It's in Aramaic.
 Okay, I get it.
 She's old.
 It was delivered by a Roman centurion.
 Oh, jeez, I've got a problem.
 If you got her pregnant, we can get a full page in Ripley's.
 Give it a rest, Charlie.
 Come on, I've been working on these all morning.
 Listen to this.
 Her first car was a chariot.
 She called her first husband "Hun" because he was one.
 Her first Christmas was the first Christmas.
 Likes to take long walks on the beach after crawling out of the ocean and growing legs.
 Her birthstone is lava.
 And finally, the big bang I don't have a joke for that yet, but I know there's something.
 I'm leaving.
 Oh, come on, I'm your brother.
 You can talk to me.
 Okay, I promise, no more jokes.
 - Tell me what the problem is.
 - Okay.
 Well, you know she's rich, right? Richer than God who she's known since he was yay high.
 You promised.
 Sorry, yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well, last night Norma made me a business proposition.
 I'll bet it involved No.
 No.
 No.
 No telegraphs, no flying machines.
 No Nina, no Pinta, no Santa Maria.
 You don't have to bite my head off.
 I was talking about what I do for a living and she said she wanted to invest in me.
 Invest in you? How? She wants to buy a building and create the Alan Harper Healing Center.
 Chiropractics, acupuncture, holistic pharmacy, aromatherapy Why don't you just call it the Alan Harper House of Crap? Norma chose the name.
 I see.
 And in exchange for all this, she expects you to: Well, nothing has been said explicitly, but yeah.
 - And you're considering it? - No.
 No, of course not.
 - Not really.
 - Not really? Well, the building would be in Beverly Hills and it would have my name on the top.
 I'm thinking Helvetica.
 Okay, I see your dilemma.
 - We gotta think this through.
 - Thanks, thanks.
 I really need to.
 You'd do her for free if she was young and beautiful, right? Well, sure, I I suppose.
 And you'd stick your dingus in a beehive for, say, a hundred million, wouldn't you? A hundred million dollars? Probably.
 But where are we going with this? We've established that you're a manwhore now we're just trying to zero in on your price.
 Charlie, you're not helping at all.
 Alan, did you really think I would? - Good to see you again, Ms.
 Seabury.
 - Thank you, Bobby.
 - My pleasure.
 - Thank you.
 Good luck.
 Go away, Bobby.
 So, Alan have you given any more thought to my little business proposal? Well, actually, I have and Oh, wait, I forgot.
 I brought you a little gifty.
 Oh, no, Norma, plea You've been too kind already Oh, my God, a Rolex.
 - A platinum Rolex.
 - A platinum Rolex.
 I have always wanted a platinum Rolex.
 I almost bought one for myself, but silly me I got health insurance for family instead.
 - Let me put it on you.
 - Okay.
 It's It's a lot heavier than my calculator Swatch.
 I'm glad you like it.
 Champagne for madame and her special friend.
 Hey, Bobby, look.
 Very nice, sir.
 This is too much.
 I can't accept this.
 Oh, I think you can.
 Yeah, I probably can.
 A toast.
 To the Alan Harper Healing Center.
 - Okay.
 - And to us.
 To us as As business partners and friends, right? Wrong.
 - Alan? - What? I proposed a toast.
 Oh, yes.
 I'm sorry, it's just -  this is all happening so fast.
 - Y es.
 Well, the heart wants what the heart wants.
 The question is, Alan what do you want? Hurry up, sugar buns.
 I'm not getting any younger.
 Charlie.
 Wake up.
 What? What's wrong? I had sex with Norma.
 - What? - I gave in.
 I folded.
 I let her have her way with me.
 How was it? Actually it was great.
 She knew stuff.
 - Is that a Rolex? - Yeah.
 Platinum.
 Nice.
 And you get a building in Beverly Hills.
 Not bad for a night's work.
 Well, actually, I I don't think I'm gonna be getting the building.
 She reneged? She died.
 You're kidding.
 After we were done she looked at me mumbled a couple of words, closed her eyes and then: Dead.
 That's it.
 I knew there was a big bang joke.
 I mean, I'm sorry.
 I just can't believe it.
 Me neither.
 After all those years of making me miserable she's actually gone.
 It's weird, I I feel a little sad.
 Imagine how I feel.
 Yeah, you killed her.
 So, what did she mumble before she, you know Well, I'm not sure, but I think she said: "I want my watch back.
 " Hey, I tried my best to keep up with her.
 I've been up half the night with the police and the coroners.
 You have no idea how judgmental those people are.
 You can't worry about what anyone else thinks, Alan.
 The thing you gotta remember and keep close to your heart is I get an extra parking space and you get to keep the watch.
 Enjoy it, buddy.
 But how can I enjoy it? The same way I enjoy that grand piano downstairs.
 What does your piano have any Wait a minute.
 Are Are you saying that? That you slept with Norma? Hey, I needed a piano.
 So So if you slept with Norma, why did she hate you so much? Probably because I only needed one piano.
 You're right, though.
 She did know stuff.
 Hey, can you put on channel 84? I wanna watch Reverend Don.
 Well, I wanna watch football.
 It's the Lord's day.
 Yeah, but it's my TV.
 - Who'd you bet on? - Packers minus one and a half.
 If the Vikings don't score, I'm up a grand.
 Okay.
 What are you doing? Praying for the Vikings to score.
 Don't do that.
 Are you crazy? - Change the channel to Reverend Don.
 - No.
 Then you leave me no choice.
 Okay, you wanna play that way? Fine.
 It won't work.
 God answers kids' prayers first.
 - Who told you that? - Nobody.
 It just makes sense.
 That last drive put the Vikings in field goal range.
 Oh, God, oh, God.
 T oo little, too late.
 Here comes the Vikings kicking unit out onto the field.
 Pray for my side I'll give you a piece of my winnings.
 - How much? - Five percent.
 No deal.
 Edinger has yet to miss from this distance.
 - Okay, 10.
 - Twenty.
 - Twenty? - And there's the snap.
 - Deal.
 - The kick is up.
 - It's good.
 - Oh, no.
 Don't blame me.
 You' re a sinner.

                    			Pretty fancy prices here. Yeah, well, just so we're clear, I am picking up the tab tonight. - Okay. - This is my celebration. I invited you. Fine. - So don't go grabbing the check. - I won't touch the check. If you wanna leave the tip, that'd be okay. I could do that. I usually leave 15 percent but if you wanna leave 20, that's your call. Thank you. Unless you think it's easier if we just split the check. Whatever. Of course, in many families if someone is celebrating some good news his brother would insist on buying dinner. - Then why don't I do that. - But I'll leave the tip. - One question. - What? - Do you have any money? - No. I left my wallet at home. You mean this wallet? Oh, good, you found it. I was looking all over. So where did we leave things? You're paying, we're splitting? Oh, just shut up. What's this good news you're celebrating? It's a surprise. I wanna wait till Mom gets here. Yes, Jake, we see the spoon on your nose, now stop it. Can you do it? I don't want to do it. Now, behave yourself. Oh, work with me. Just wonderful. You pick a restaurant that has no valet. I had to park three blocks away and then schlep here in shoes that are not for walking. I've got a blister the size of a Communion wafer. And if Mommy doesn't get something to drink immediately things are going to get very ugly. Let the celebration begin. Maybe the lesson here, Mom, is to buy shoes that are made for walking. Is it just me? In a perfect world, it would be. Well, anyway I'm here. So, what's your big announcement, Alan? Jake, get that spoon off your nose. - You don't know where it's been. - It's been on my nose. You really must start looking at trade schools for the boy. Now that we are all here, I have some good news to share. This is not gonna be on the newsstands for a couple of days but I have an advance copy. "Good doctor, good neighbor, good guy. " Good God. - Hey, Dad, you're famous. - Well, not really. Well, among the readers of the Tarzana Pennysaver, maybe a little. Don't forget the homeless people who make underpants out of it. Charlie, don't be disrespectful. Thank you, Mom. So how much advertising did you have to buy in exchange for this puff piece? Why do you assume that I had to buy advertising? Is it that hard to believe that a local newspaper might run a cover story about a successful local chiropractor? Well, frankly, yes. Unless the chiropractor shot four people to death in a mini-mart and then turned the weapon on himself. You know, I get why Charlie has never acknowledged my accomplishments. He's a hedonist who can't get behind anyone unless they're drunk and bent over a pool table. That's fair. But my own mother You're up. Refusing to even feign interest. I did so feign interest. You assumed I had to buy advertising to get the article. Well, did you? Neighborhood advertising is a good investment. - But that is not the point. - All right, what is the point? The point is, I can't even get a simple attaboy from own my mother. Oh, well, I'm sorry. Attaboy. Feel better? - No, I do not feel better. - Did I not say it right? You know what? Forget it. Let's just order, eat and get out of here. One more of these, and please keep them coming. I'll buy the drinks. Unless you wanna split it with me. And you know what else? You know what else? No, Alan, what else? I cannot believe that our mother made us carry her to her car just because she had a teeny-weeny little blister on her foot. Well, hopefully the next time we have to carry her she'll be in a handy urn. I'll pay for the urn if you get the cremation. Done. - Jake? Where's my son? - Right here, Dad. Oh, oh, good, good. Now, listen, boy. Your old dad is not going to be here for Is not going to be here forever. And when I'm gone I want there to be no doubt in your mind that I was as proud as punch about all of your accomplishments, no matter how miniscule. Boy, you're really plowed, aren't you? No. Your daddy doesn't get plowed. He just gets a little: Anyway, the important thing for you to know is how much I love you. You told the waiter you loved him too. He was a very good waiter. And it's also important for you to know that you can be anything you want. Anything in the world. - No, I can't. - You're right. That's a crock. But I love you and you have cheeks like a beaver. Now go to bed. Dad, we've been learning about alcohol abuse at school. And if you ever need a new liver you can have half of mine. Hey, hey, hey. I thought we had a deal. Oh, yeah. Sorry, Dad. Best 5 bucks I ever spent. Now come on, let's tuck you into bed. Why can't my mother appreciate me? All I wanted was one sincere attaboy. Was that too much to ask? Attaboy. Well, that looks like the last of the scallops. Now all we gotta do is wait for dessert. Rainbow sherbet. Oh, that should be pretty. You know, I have spent my entire life trying to please Mom to make her proud of me. But no more. I am done trying. Good for you. Oh, excuse me. Nope. You know, if you put the seat down, it's easier to rest your arms. Oh, you're right. You're a wise man, Charlie Harper. Well, I do have a few pockets of specialized knowledge. Some might call it wisdom. And it seems warmer too. It's further away from the cooling effect of the water. Not to mention the residual body heat accrued from thousands of ass hours. You've really given a lot of thought to this. I'm thinking of writing a book. And I will read it. Thank you. You know what I am, Charlie? Yes. I am a pathological people pleaser. I had an entirely different answer. But more accurately, I am a woman pleaser. No, Alan, I am a woman pleaser. You're a lonely guy speckled with vomit. No, I'm not speaking physically, I'm speaking psychologically. With Mom. With Judith. With every woman I've ever met. I have twisted myself into knots just trying to get them to like me. My education my job, my clothes, my car my very behavior. All chosen simply to get women to approve of me. And how's that worked out for you? They don't approve of me. But I am going to change, Charlie. I am no longer going to grovel for Mom's approval or for the approval of any woman. I am going to live the remainder of my life with pride and a quiet, noble dignity. But first, I'll sleep with my head in the crapper. Can I make you some oatmeal? I've got cereal. I know. I just thought you might enjoy something hot and quiet. Nope. Do you have a hangover? Yeah. Drinking that much was a stupid thing to do. So then why'd you do it? I don't know, Jake. - Maybe I'm just stupid. - Or maybe you just don't apply yourself. Can we stop talking for a while? Okay. Although I do like a little conversation at breakfast. Morning, everybody. He's hung-over. Oh, yeah. Well, isn't this an ironic turn of events? Me, waking up feeling all bright and chipper. And you looking like a stool sample. Not a big irony fan, huh? - Charlie? - Yeah. Either stop talking or at least have the decency to kill me. - Boy, I'm never gonna drink. - Good job. You scarred the kid for life. Now he's gonna have to face junior high sober. - Just tell me one thing. - What's that? Did I really tell the waiter I loved him last night? You had to say something after a kiss like that. Oh, God. - I took care of your bathroom. - Thank you. I hope you like the smell of pine-scented puke. So did I do anything else I'm gonna regret? - Well, you paid for dinner. - Jeez. And after we got home there was some drunken blubbering about how you weren't going to grovel for women. Oh, right. I almost forgot. I had a life-changing epiphany last night. Before or after you yakked up a hunk of your esophagus? No, no, it's no joke. I've reached a turning point. From this day on, my actions will no longer be predicated on pleasing the castrating mother figures in my life. - What's so funny? - Nothing. I think she doubts your epiphany. She'll see. They'll all see. Starting now, I am a new Alan. Oh, damn, I think I wet myself. Starting now, I will fear no woman's disapproval. Oh, God, that's Judith. I was supposed to have Jake ready. She's gonna kill me. Okay, starting now. Good for you. - Oh, I better get that. - Let her wait. What she thinks of you doesn't matter. What counts is what you think of you. You're right. It's what I think of me. - Alan? - I had so much potential. Okay, forget what you think of you. Yeah, I'm probably too close to me to see me clearly. Yeah, that's it. Oh, do I smell like vomit? Don't worry, I'll stand next to you. She'll assume it's me. Good, good. Hi, Alan. Jake ready? - No, he is not. - You said you'd have him ready. Well, I don't. And if that makes you unhappy with me, well, I don't give a rat's furry ass. - What did you just say to me? - Nothing, I'm sorry. Jake. - Starting now? - Starting soon. You know what that smell is? Epiphany for men. So how long you been in Los Angeles? About eight months. Haven't got a single audition yet. Yeah, this can be a tough town when you don't know anybody. So do you have like a headshot or a rsum? - Is he okay? - I don't know. Sir, are you okay? - I thought we came here to talk. - Not to each other. - Let's talk. What's bothering you? - I changed my mind -  I don't wanna talk about it. - Talk or die. All right. I'm depressed. I wanna change but I can't. Whenever I'm confronted by a disapproving woman, something inside me crumbles. Well, Alan, maybe that's just who you are. You know, fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, you gotta crumble. What I don't understand is I can intellectually see the problem but I just can't do anything about it. Excuse me. Can I have more of these little pretzels? - In a minute. - Okay, sorry. No hurry. Look, it's very simple. You were conditioned to seek Mom's approval. You're still seeking Mom's approval and you make every woman a substitute mom. But what about you? We had the same mother. I handle my conditioning in a different way. I have casual and often degrading sex with my substitute moms but we're talking about you and not me so forget I said that. Oh, how I'll try. But how do you deal with the fear of disapproval? I mean, you must get shot down occasionally. Occasionally? Constantly. Constantly? Occasionally. It's a numbers game, Alan. We all want the shiny apple on top of the tree. But sometimes you gotta settle for one on a lower branch. Of course, there's times you pick up whatever's lying on the ground and put it in your mouth. But how do you manage to keep going on in the face of constant rejection? Occasional rejection. Okay, lesson one: Look around. Out of all the women here, which one do you find the most attractive? Let's see. Her. The brunette? Why? I don't know, there's just something about her. - Yeah, radiating waves of contempt. - You asked me who I found attractive. That's true. She's your shiny apple. Now go ask her if you can buy her a drink. What about the radiating waves of contempt? That's just a defense mechanism for a girl in a lot of pain. - Really? - How the hell should I know? The point is, you can't let fear stand in your way. - Well, I disagree. - Are you questioning my methods? - Because we can stop right now. - No, no, I'll do it. I'll do it. Would you like some more pretzels? Well, I am in the mood for something salty and twisted. - You're terrible. - You have no idea. - How'd it go? - She's really got a mouth on her. So she rejected you? With anatomical specificity. - Good. - Good? How is that good? - How do you feel now? - What do you mean, how do I feel? - I feel humiliated. - Where? - What? - Where is the humiliation? - Where do you feel it? - Oh, well, let's see. My stomach's all knotted, my heart is pounding, I'm sweating like a pig. Okay, end of lesson one. That was lesson one? Lesson one sucked. Lesson two: Have a drink. No, sweetheart, have a real drink. - I don't like Scotch. - It's okay, it's bourbon. Oh, all right. More. How do you feel now? - I feel a little better. - Finish the drink. Can I put some diet Sprite in it? Just finish it. There you go. Now how do you feel? I feel pretty good. Like, to hell with her. Who cares what she thinks? Perfect. Now go ask that chick over there if you can buy her a drink. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, that's your big secret? Alcohol? Don't tell anybody. - Isn't that just a temporary solution? - It's only temporary if you stop drinking. I like it. Diet Sprite. I gotta hand it to you, Alan. Most guys would be off scallops for a long time. I like scallops. But clearly they don't like you. I guess you choose your seafood like you choose your women. I beg to differ. When it comes to women, I make them sick. Fair enough. So, what else did we learn tonight? Well, let's see. I learned that to overcome my fear of rejection ingrained in me by an emotionally distant mother I need to completely disable my central nervous system with semi-lethal quantities of alcohol. Bravo. Hey, Charlie, are you coming to bed or what? I'll be there in a second. - What're you looking at? - Sorry. Very sorry. So how've you been? It worked. I am totally humiliated and I don't care. You made real progress tonight. I'm proud of you. Thanks, Charlie. You're a good teacher and a good brother. Thanks. Well, I guess it's time for me to go work out my issues. Good night, pal. Nighty-night. SDl Media Group   





                    			- Good morning. - Morning. Charlie, right? Well, I guess it's too late to deny it. Would you like some coffee? Sure I would. You have a beautiful house. Thank you so much. My name's Sandy. Yes, of course it is. How could I forget? Sandy like the beach, or the Koufax. - Pardon me? - You know, Sandy Koufax. Great Dodger pitcher, hall-of-famer Never mind. So, Sandy how did you sleep? Just fine. How about you? Great. Like a drunk baby. Are you hungry? Not yet. Maybe after I throw up. What did you do last night? I was hoping you could fill me in. There's my little Sandy beach. Good morning, Alley-Oop. Oh, thank God. I was afraid I was gonna have to quit drinking. So, what do you think of Sandy? Arguably the greatest southpaw in the history of baseball. My Sandy. I don't know, I've never seen her pitch. - But she sure can cook. - Well, guess how we met. I suppose we can rule out Dodger Stadium. In cooking class. You've been taking a class? - Where do you think I go every Tuesday? - You're not here on Tuesday nights? No, I'm in cooking class. And guess who's the teacher? - Who? - Sandy. Who's Sandy? That's Sandy. Great story. - Alan is my star pupil. - And you are my star teacher. So cute. Yo. - Can I have some more bacon? - Oh, in a jiff. My mother always said, "A well-fed man is a happy man. " Our mother always said, "Here's Oh, that reminds me, she called and invited us for Christmas. - You told her yes, right? - Absolutely. You and I were going to spend Christmas together. We are. - But you're going to your mother's. - What gave you that idea? You see, Sandy, it's kind of a family tradition. Our mother invites us even though she doesn't want us to come. We say yes even though we don't wanna go. When we don't show, though she's relieved she gets to complain about what horrible children she has. It's the perfect gift. Christmas is supposed to be about spending time with your loved ones. Yeah, going to our mother's would cut into that. Alan gets to spend it with his son and I get to play Stuff the Stocking in Vegas with a couple of saline-enhanced elves. Does this mean that I'm finally going to meet your son? I guess it does. Gosh, I so hope he likes me. The way you cook the only problem is gonna be keeping him from humping your leg. That's the sheets. If you fold them while they're warm, they don't wrinkle. Beauty, sex, cooking, laundry. Marriage, boredom, alimony, death. You are such a cynic. - And you are such a sap. - How am I a sap? - Are you blind? She's a nester. - What's that supposed to mean? She throws you some tail, a couple of pieces of bacon and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo, got a roommate. "Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo"? Isn't that from Cinderella? You don't think that bitch was a nester? Anyway, I find that a couple of drops of lemon juice on the dryer sheet really freshens up the whole load. Really? I find that just a couple valiums in my coffee keeps me from snapping necks. Well, hold this, please I'm just going to pop these on the bed while they're still warm and toasty. So which one of you guys is slipping the high hard one to Martha Stewart? Hey, Brandi. It's Charlie Harper. I'm coming to Vegas for Christmas and was wondering if you and your sister wanted to celebrate again. Harper. Oh, wait, it's possible that you remember me as Dr. Philip Gonzalez. Right. Yeah, hola. Anyway, I'm sitting here making vacation plans and I'm thinking: "Where better to commemorate the birth of our lord than Caesar's Palace? " Hey, Charlie. Hungry? Hold on, Brandi. - Not really, but listen - Last chance. I'm gonna start dinner so the kitchen's gonna be off limits. - But it's my kitchen. - So? I just thought it was important to point out. You're so cute. Look, Brandi, talk to your sister, work up an estimate and I'll call you back. Oh, hi, Berta. Oh, I've got a surprise for you. - A mini-blind brush. - A what? I don't think Alan's blinds have been dusted. Probably because you didn't have the proper tool. Gee, thanks. - We gotta talk. - I'm on it. You better be, or else she's gonna be on it. Because now I have the proper tool. - Hey, listen. - You had your chance, Charlie. - If you're hungry, take a pudding cup. - I don't want a pudding cup. - We need to establish ground rules. - Oh, okay, I'm listening. Okay, well, first of all, Berta's been with me for a long time. And what she lacks in housekeeping skills she more than makes up for in upper-body strength. What's that? - Rack of lamb. - Really? - You're making that for us? - Yep. With roasted baby potatoes and caramelized carrots. Anyway, anyway. Ground rules. I wanna be supportive of you and Alan Sorry. One quick question. Chocolate or raspberry souffl? - It doesn't matter, the point is - I'll just make raspberry. Actually, I prefer chocolate. Chocolate it is. Now, why don't I mix you up a little cocktail -  and you can take a nap before dinner? - A nap would be nice. Can I still have the pudding cup? Okay, but just one. I don't want you spoiling your appetite before dinner. Thank you. Go on. - Well? - Good news. We're having rack of lamb. Oh, no. I'm hungry. Where's Sandy? She went to get a honey-baked ham for Christmas Eve dinner. Honey-baked ham. I find it a little ironic that despite your warnings about her nesting instincts you haven't missed a single one of her meals. Yeah, I'm a master of irony. - I thought you were going to Vegas. - Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Then you'd have the whole ham to yourself. You should talk, Porky. Who took the lasagna under the deck so we wouldn't see him eat it all himself? Who made a meatloaf sandwich by taking a slice of meatloaf and putting it between two other slices of meatloaf? I am cutting down on carbs. Yeah, it's working for you. When's the last time you looked down in the shower and saw your testicles? I don't need to see them. I know they're there. And what about you? What do you call this? Goodyear or Pirelli? This, my chunky friend, is water weight. Water weight. It's genetic. I retain water. You also retain German chocolate cake, lamb stew and Belgian waffles. Hey, people who live in fat asses shouldn't throw waffles. Don't talk about my ass. I am very self-conscious about my ass. I'm I'm sorry. I'm just lashing out because I haven't eaten in 75 minutes. Want some of Sandy's homemade fudge? Don't play with me, Alan. - You've got fudge up here? - Close your eyes. Okay. Fudge. You know what would be great? Honey-baked fudge. Or fudge-covered ham. Well, I'm really happy we get to spend Christmas together. We don't have to go to your mom's, do we? Don't be silly. Hey, you hungry? - I could eat. - Well, you're gonna. Can we order Chinese like we did last year? No, this year we're gonna do something a little more traditional. Deli? No, we're gonna have a real, home-cooked Christmas dinner. Whose home? - Our home. - How? Well, I am dating a lady who's gonna make us a wonderful dinner. Oh, okay. Are you at all curious? Yeah, a little. Okay, you can ask me any question and I'll try and answer it for you. What are we having? No, about the lady. No, not really. Well, I just want you to know that I really like her and you're probably gonna be seeing her a lot. Do I have to like her? - Well, of course not. - Then I probably won't. Why would you say that? We're very different people, Dad. So true. Is she gonna be staying over? - Yes. - Where is she gonna sleep? In my room. Okay. Just remember, the walls are thin and I'm impressionable. Hey, what are you doing out here? I thought I should prepare you. For what? Alan. Remember what I told you about nesters? Yeah. Well, some are hummingbirds, some are robins. But you, my friend you've got yourself a partridge in a freaking pear tree. - Sandy did all this? - Yep. I think it's cool. It's like an amusement park. Yeah, Six Flags Over Crazy-Ass-Chick Land. This cannot be Jake. You're too grown-up-looking. Yeah, thanks. Are those for anybody? Help yourselves. Gingerbread. Jake, you can help me in the kitchen. I'm making chocolate clairs and I need an official taster. I like her. Will you look at that? They're bonding already. Alan, your kid would join the T aliban if they made their own s'mores. - So when did she do all this decorating? - Hard to say. - Everything was normal until lunchtime. - Oh, I missed lunch. What did you have? She made me a bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich with garlic mayonnaise on sourdough toast. Oh, damn. Anyway, after lunch I took a little nap and woke up in Santa's Village of the Damned. Why do you have to be so cynical? There is nothing wrong with decorating your home to show a little holiday spirit. But it's not her home, is it? Well, no. - Whose home is it, Alan? - Okay, fine, I will have a talk with her. - Hold it. - What? After dinner, you nimrod. Anybody have room for another clair? Not unless I unbutton my pants. Mine are already unbuttoned. I took mine off when she brought out the marshmallow yams. Okay, then. What do you say we all go into the living room and sing some Christmas carols? - You mean stand up? - I don't think I can. I'm not wearing pants. Come on, you guys, what's Christmas without caroling? Hanukkah? Sandy? Something wrong? Who moved the reindeer? I don't know that one, but I'll wing it. Who moved the reindeer? The savior's come He's coming to check on the rein No, no, no. - These reindeer. - What about them? Donner and Blitzen are out of order. - Somebody's been playing with them. - So? So I wanna know who it was. - Jake? - I didn't do it. Charlie? Oh, all right, I may have used one of them as a swizzle stick. Well, no harm done. If you must play with them, please remember it's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen. Okay. Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen. - Got it. - Say it. Donner, Blitzen. Okay, then. "The Little Drummer Boy. " Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen. Alan. Why aren't you asleep? I don't know. Just excited about Christmas, I guess. Well, Santa won't come while you're awake. Yeah. Yeah, I've heard that. Now close your eyes and let visions of sugarplums dance through your wee little head. Okay. - Oh, no. - What? I forgot to put out cookies and milk for Santa. You're kidding, right? Do you want coal in your stocking? That's what you're gonna get if Santa doesn't find a snack when he comes. I see. So you believe in the vengeful, Old Testament Santa. Are you mocking Christmas? No, no, no. You know what? I'll take care of the milk and cookies. You just relax and go to sleep. He sees us when we're sleeping, you know? Right. I don't make the rules. Okay. Oh, God, oh, God Oh, God, oh, God - Charlie? - Hang on. Okay, I'm ready for more pie. We have a serious problem here. We're out of pie? Will you listen? There's something wrong with Sandy. Well, didn't we know that when she agreed to sleep with you? No, no, even wronger than that. She actually believes in Santa Claus. - Really? - Yeah. But we still have pie? - Yes, we still have pie. - Then what are we doing up here? I guess I could have a little sliver. You know what? I think something's wrong with Sandy. I just said that. Do you ever listen to me? Sandy, sweetheart? - You okay? - He's not coming. Who's not coming? Listen to this. Santa. Every year, I try to make things perfect. And every year I fail. Mama was right. I am a naughty girl. Come on, Alan. Where are we going? I want you to teach this naughty girl a lesson. She needs to be punished. You lucky dog. What? I'm not going in there. She's nuts. Yeah, so? Sex with crazy chicks is great. Make sure you pick positions where you can see what her hands are doing. No. No, that would be taking advantage of a mentally unbalanced person. Oh, Alan, that boat has sailed. You might as well hop on board for a farewell cruise. I don't think so. It just wouldn't be right. Come on, Alan, I'm ready. Good night. Okay, pie for everybody. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Are you out of your mind? You've been nagging us for years to spend Christmas with you. Only because I knew you'd never show up. Well, we had to get out of the house. Y eah, the walls are thin and I'm impressionable. Hold on. Stanley, put your pants on. We'll exchange gifts later. Come on in. Dear God, look at the size of your ass. SDl Media Group   





                    			I just wanna be clear that I am here as a last resort. I understand. I don't have a lot of faith in psychiatry as a science. I think some of the drugs you're pushing are interesting. And I'm all for messing around with brain chemistry. I mean, that's how I got through high school. But in my experience, popping pills doesn't relieve social anxiety quite as well as, say, bourbon and Marvin Gaye. No, I get it. You're desperate, and I'm full of hooey. So in the words of Marvin Gaye, what's going on? - Everything I say is confidential, right? - Whatever you say stays in this room. Kind of like Vegas. Well, except there's no way you're leaving here with more money than when you came in. Yeah, like Vegas. Anyway, last night I'm out with my stupid, lame-ass brother. Sounds like you've got some anger towards him. Oh, you're good. This is nice. You and me, spending time together. - Why don't we do this more often? - I don't have an answer. Well, me neither. So how long till the movie starts? About 20 minutes. Y eah, sure, 20 minutes not counting previews and ads the popcorn and the giant pretzel holding hands the big soda drinking the little soda, which, frankly, is cannibalism and the reminder to turn off your cell phones and shut up. But nobody does, because good manners are just the latest casualty in the ongoing collapse of Western civilization. I now have an answer. - I miss Jake. - How can you miss him? We just dropped him off at his friend's house. By the way, if you get tired of those magazines under your bed the kid's mom looked fairly doable. Forget the mom. Did you see how happy Jake was spending the weekend away? Why would you think that? Just because he jumped out of the car while it was moving? Alan, he was happy to see his friends. Being away from you is just gravy. I know, I know. It's natural for him to want to spend more time with his peers than his parents. But all the same, it's sad. Yeah, sunrise, sunset. One day you're holding a baby in your arms and the next day he's off hawking loogies and lighting farts with a bunch of Ritalin-addled sixth graders. Why do I bother to share my feelings with you? I don't know. It's not like I encourage it. Oh, come on, so your kid doesn't need you like he used to. That's a good thing. You can spend your weekends enjoying yourself. That's true. I mean, there are things I wanna do that I haven't had time for. Like that kid's mom. No, no, I mean like Like reading. Finally cracking open the classics. Alan, if you wanna crack something open, I recommend that kid's mom. No, no, I'm serious. You know, for years I have been wishing that I had time to read all the great books. You know, Dostoyevsky and Hemingway Faulkner and Dickens and Shakespeare. And history, history. U.S U.S. history, world history, the history of language. I mean, why doesn't anyone speak Sumerian anymore? I don't know, because I haven't read the book. And, oh, poetry, poetry. Byron and Keats and Shelley. And biographies. Julius Caesar and Abraham Lincoln and, oh, Groucho Marx. I mean I mean, look at them all. Look at them, they're mocking me. I haven't read any of them. Okay, well, just pick one for now. Why bother? There's not enough time. There's too many books, and there's not enough time. Maybe you just need a system. Put a book next to the toilet. Every couple of days, knock out a couple chapters. No, no, it's too late for me. There's not enough bowel movements left. - Maybe you need to change your diet. - No, it's hopeless. Jake will be grown up soon and I'll be dead. And you know what I'll have left behind? A life of unfulfilled dreams, a shelf of unread books and three unopened seasons of Six Feet Under on DVD. So, what are you doing tonight? All right. So your brother had a panic attack in the middle of a bookstore. How'd that make you feel? What the hell do my feelings have to do with anything? Why don't you just humor me? Well, I felt a little ashamed. Because you felt that his behavior reflected on you? No, because I left him there. You left him? Not permanently. I came back and got him after he was all cried out and it was time for the movie. So you still went to the movie? Yeah, I bought the tickets online. They don't refund those. Red Vine? No, thank you. I am so sorry. I don't know what came over me. Who among us hasn't collapsed, weeping, in the middle of a bookstore for no apparent reason? You know, I think maybe I'd be better off at home. So I'm supposed to miss the movie just because you had a nervous breakdown? Well, kind of. Don't you think that's a little selfish, Alan? It's just, all of a sudden I felt crushed by this unbelievable sense of grief like my entire life has been an exercise in pathetic futility. Well, I wouldn't rule it out. Come on, bunky, cheer up. Have a Red Vine. I don't want a Red Vine. - Sno-Cap? - No. - Raisinet? - No. - Goobers? - How much crap did you buy? They couldn't change a hundred. All right, I'll have a Junior Mint. I didn't get Junior Mints. Of course not. Story of my life. No Junior Mints for Alan. Just Goobers. Goobers, Goobers, Goobers. - Dude, dude, you need to be quiet. - Why? Why? The First Amendment gives me the right to yell in a crowded theater. Goobers! Hey, look, movie quiz. - Let's play the movie quiz. - I don't wanna play the movie quiz. - It'll be fun. I'll bet you're good at it. - All right. "Debra Winger and Richard Gere starred in An Officer and a blank. " - Oh, please. - You need a hint? - There's a hint in the corner. - No, I don't need a hint. I know the answer. Everybody here knows the answer. Everybody on the planet knows the answer. - We're not stupid. - Chill, chill. Oh, wait. Oh, here's another brainteaser. "Steven Spielberg directed this modern retelling of the H.G. Wells classic War of the blank. " - Couch. War of the Couch. - Stop it. Oh, wait, no, no, I got it. War of the Blow-It-Out- Your-Ass. You know what? Maybe you' re right. Maybe we should go. Oh, wait, no, I know this one. "Johnny Depp cruised to success in this comedy-action film inspired by a Disneyland attraction. " Pirates of the Blow-It-Out- Your-Ass. He's He's behind on his reading. Oh, and let's not forget Judy Garland in that immortal classic The Wizard of Blow-It-Out- Your-Ass. That sounds like quite an episode. Is your brother seeing a therapist? How would I know? He's your brother. He lives with you. So? All right, go ahead. Just because I took him in, doesn't mean I listen to him. I understand. He just whines about the same crap over and over. - Okay. - It's not even interesting crap. It's the crap that bores the crap out of crap. I got it. It's crap. Go ahead. Thank you. So we're driving home, and This seat is very comfortable. Genuine leather, nine-way adjustable, lumbar support. It's I wish I'd have spent a few extra bucks and gotten the ejection package. - I said I was sorry. - They don't refund those tickets, Alan. - I wanna go see Jake. - Why? He's at a sleepover. I've just got this feeling that he needs me. You mean like some sort of telepathic thing? - Exactly. - I see. - Did you know I was gonna do that? - No. Then I wouldn't trust your psychic powers. Oh, come on. We can just stop by for a few minutes. We have time now, since we decided to skip the movie. Oh, we decided that, did we? That's the way it went down for you, huh? That's how you interpret recent events? Settle down. You're acting like a crazy person. Me? I'm acting like a crazy person? Are you freaking kidding me? Listen to yourself. You're getting a little scary right now. Okay, fine. You wanna see the kid, we'll go see the kid. Thank you. Was that so hard? Charlie? The road. Please? You know, when you have kids you find there's a deep, spiritual connection. You feel an actual tug when your child needs you. Interesting. What do you feel when your brother hates you? Alan. Is everything okay? Oh, yeah, fine. I just need to see Jake for a minute. - He's feeling a tug. - A tug? Or it could be gas. We're not sure. Well, could you just call Jake? Jake, your father's here! Put that down, Timmy! - What? - I just wanted to see if you were okay. Oh, great, now I'm dead. Thanks a lot. It doesn't count. I was talking to my stupid dad. Well, it It seems like you've got everything under control here. Actually, I ran out of ice cream. Do you think you could keep an eye on the kids for a few minutes? - Well - Thanks a million. I'll be right back. She ain't coming back. Three hours she was gone. And when she finally came back, she was reeking of Old Spice and pot. - I see. - And she didn't even have any ice cream. All right, let's stop here for a minute and talk in general about your feelings towards women. No, thanks. - Rather discuss your childhood? - Nope. - Father? Mother? - Dead. Killed him. - Would you like to discuss that? - We just did. Charlie, I'm not sure we're on the same page here. Have you ever been in therapy before? - Does massage therapy count? - No. It's almost the same thing. One-on-one with a strange woman who charges you for the hour and then only gives you 50 minutes? Why don't we just go back to your story? Touch a nerve there, did I? Okay, okay. Well, Jake ignored his father the entire time we were there, so Alan was a little upset when we got back in the car. He hates me. My only son hates me. He doesn't hate you. He just didn't appreciate you telling his friends that laser tag can induce epileptic fits. - Well, it can. - Be that as it may you could've gotten your point across without flopping on the floor rolling your eyes up, and pretending to swallow your tongue. Hey, hey. A picture is worth a thous Charlie, stop the car. - Why? - I have to get out. - I'm feeling claustrophobic. - There's no place to stop. - We have to stop! - Where? I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I have to get out. - I have to get out now. Now, now, now. - Okay, okay, hold on. Hold on. The seat belt won't come off. - Just push the button. - I can't, I can't. - It won't come off. Help me. - Okay, okay, move your hands. Okay. It's passing. It's Yes. I'm okay. - No, you're not. - What? - Get out. - What? Get out now. Now, now, now. Get out. Get out. That's better. So you just left your brother on the side of the road? He couldn't believe it either. You should've seen his face in the rear-view mirror. All right, Charlie, we've been talking for quite a while, and I gotta tell you: I still don't understand why you came to see me. You in a hurry? Doesn't that undermine your whole pay-by-the-hour business model? - Go ahead. - Thank you. So as I was driving away, I decided I needed a little quiet time for, you know, reflection and meditation. - Hey. - Hey. What took you so long? I was sure you'd come back. I guess that's case closed on the telepathy stuff. - What are you drinking? - I don't know, something soothing. - Kahlua and cream. - He's kidding. Give him a beer. - Must you always embarrass me? - Hey, I have had a traumatic night. I feel very exposed, vulnerable, confused Y eah, yeah, yeah. Okay, shut up, shut up, shut up. - Hi. - Hi. - Yeah, hi. - Can we buy you ladies a drink? - No, thanks. We're already pretty blitzed. - Boy, are we blitzed. Perfect. I'm Charlie. This is Alan. - Amy. - Beth. Nice to meet you. How's it going tonight? - Pretty good. - We're blitzed. - How about you? - Yeah, how you doing? - Oh, boy. Where to start? - No one's talking to you. - What's the matter, Alan? - Yeah, what's the matter? Well, you really wanna know? They don't. Trust me, you really don't. Well, maybe it's a late reaction to the divorce. Maybe it's my son not needing me so much now that he's growing up but I think it's more than that. I think it's just life grinding me down, and I just I don't think I can take it anymore. - Oh, you poor baby. - Poor, poor baby. - Tell us all about it. - Yeah, tell us. Well, I was never a happy child. Oh, God, I was a miserable kid. And the only thing that gave my life meaning was my son. At least you've got a son. I've got nothing, except epilepsy. - Oh, no. - Yeah, oh, no. So anyway, there I was on my wedding day in front of the priest and all our friends flopping around on the altar like an epileptic trout when I heard her father say: "You can't marry this man. He's damaged goods. " - Oh, gee. - Yeah, oh, gee. That's when I realized that all the money in the world And I do have a lot. can't replace that special tug you feel when someone loves you unconditionally. - Look, Beth, the ocean. - Oh, the ocean. - Let's go skinny-dipping. - Yeah. - You wanna come? - Yeah, come with us. I'd love to, but I'm too sad and I might swallow my tongue. You two go. Swim, splash, frolic. Enjoy your healthy bodies. - Okay. - Bye. Have you no shame? Let me think. Nope, just a tug. And that's another thing. My angst is real. I don't appreciate you taking my tug to get in someone's pants. News flash, Alan. They're already out of their pants. And they're gonna come back cold, wet and in desperate need of body heat. For those of us with normal skin temperature, it'll be a seller's market. - You're unbelievable. - No, I just think ahead. They're gonna last two seconds in that water. We have to hurry. I'll get the wine. You light some candles. I'm sorry, I'm really not in the mood. Are you saying that I have to get you liquored up so I can get laid? All right, I'll go along, but only as a favor to you. Thank you. I'm gonna have to apply the condom and get a rope and pulley to lower one of those broads onto him. Since you're making me do this, I get Amy. The hell you do. Which one's Amy? Amy's the one who overcame the eating disorder. - Starving herself or throwing up? - Does it make a difference? - Does if you're paying for dinner. - Amy is the brunette. - Got it. So I have Jennifer. - You mean Beth. - Oh, right, right, B for "blonde. " - B can also be for "brunette. " But Amy's the brunette. So you could do A for "anorexic. " Unless it's B for "bulimic. " Good point. We're gonna need a new system. Do you smell something? Yeah, what is that? I think you do these things just to piss me off. - Oh, my God, what happened? - Well, while I was trying to put it out my brother stupidly called the fire department. Why was that stupid? Have you seen a Malibu fireman recently? They're all young, buff surfer dudes whipping their big hoses around. Amy and Beth jumped on their hook and ladder like a couple Dalmatians. We never saw them again. Yes, the Malibu Fire Department. I have several patients who compulsively masturbate to their calendar. - No kidding. - Both sexes. So, Charlie, I'm still not clear on what it is you would like me to help you with. Your anger issues? Your sexual issues? Drinking? No, no, no, that's all cool. Then tell me, why are you here? Okay, well, I'm here to lay some groundwork for the future. Some groundwork? Yeah. I've come to realize that there's a very good chance that I might someday snap and kill my brother. And I figure if I'm already under a psychiatrist's care then I can always cop an insanity plea. You're thinking of killing your brother? Doctor-patient confidentiality. Where's the bottle opener? Check in the drawer by the coffee machine. Hey, what do you think of this for the new drapes? T oo small. You know, I think it's kind of cheerful. I'll put it in the "maybe" pile. You do that. You know, we're also gonna have to reupholster the couch. - You think? - There's a lot of water damage. Which, frankly, I think was the result of the firemen showing off for the girls. You could be right. You know, I just wanna tell you I really appreciate you sticking by me in the past couple of days you know, pulling me out of my funk. You really are a great brother. - I don't know what I'd do without you. - I don't know what I'd do without you. But golly, it's sure fun to think about. SDl Media Group   





                    			- Charlie? - Yeah? We said we were gonna take things slow. We did say that. I guess we can't be trusted. - Charlie, talk to me. - All right. You know what I'm gonna do to you, you dirty, filthy girl? - No, not like that. - Wrong way? Am I a dirty, filthy boy? No, I wanna talk about us. We're a dirty, filthy couple. No, I wanna talk about our relationship. Well, that redirects the old blood flow. Okay, so what about it? - You know that I really care about you. - And I care about you too. All right, good talk. I just wanna make sure that if we do this we're doing it for the right reasons. Well, not to be contrary, but the wrong reasons kick everything up a notch. I just wanna make sure we give our relationship a chance to grow. - So you want to stop? - No, I really want you. Mia, all this starting and stopping is really not good for my transmission. I'm sorry. I'm just so confused. I That's why you're gonna have to make this decision for both of us. Me? I have to make this decision? That's like asking the fat kid to guard the pie. I trust you, Charlie. Well, that is really low. - Okay, we'll wait. - Thank you. - So, what do we do now? - We could take a walk on the beach. No, seriously. Oh, yeah. Walk on the beach. Great. I've always been meaning to do that. Good morning, everyone. - Good morning. - Looks to be a beautiful day. Overcast, but that should burn off in a few hours leaving us with a sun-dappled afternoon in paradise. You still drunk from last night or did you get a fresh buzz this morning? No, ma'am, I am quite simply high on life. Blotto. I am not drunk. Alan, guess what I did last night. - Jake. - I'm leaving. No, Jake can hear this. - Last night - Wait, wait. Hang on, Charlie. You're about to tell us something that made you happy? - Yes. - Jake. I'm leaving. Jake, stay. I want to share this with my entire family. Okay, I'm leaving. Berta, I consider you part of my family. - Am I in your will? - No, but neither are the rest of them. Now listen. Last night, I, Charlie Harper, delayed gratification. What did you do, wait till she fell asleep? - Wait for what? - Jake. - I'm leaving. - Sit down. What happened last night is I may have started a meaningful relationship. Charlie, seriously, go sleep it off. You're embarrassing yourself. Come on, listen to me. - I think I might be in love with Mia. - Big deal. You've always been in love with you-a. - Very funny. - I thought so. Did you think so? - That was pretty good. - Yeah. He's 11. He still thinks "Milk Milk Lemonade" is funny. Oh, yeah. Hello? Grandmommy's here. Oh, great. Tell Mom what you told us, Charlie. No. - Tell me what? - Nothing. - Do you need a good lawyer? - No. - Discreet doctor? - No. - Knock-off Gucci handbag? - What? There's only so many ways I can help you, dear. It's no big deal. I've just been seeing this ballet dancer. She might be the one. Drunk? He says, "No. " I think it might be one of those designer drugs. Charlie, what did you take? I'm serious. We've been seeing each other for over a month. We're waiting to sleep together until our relationship has a solid foundation. Well, we can rule out ecstasy. I mean, that's a powerful aphrodisiac. I've heard. Nowadays you're supposed to say "African American-disiac. " - Jake. - You sure this time? - Yeah. - I'm leaving. Has it occurred to you that maybe I've finally matured? Maybe I'm ready to build something with a woman that isn't solely based on sex? - Has that occurred to you? - No. Berta? So it's not just me. You know, I can understand your skepticism. I've earned it. But this girl is different. And I'm gonna make it work. I give him another week before he's out on the beach, humping wet sand. - Hey. - Hey. How was your date? Fun. We went bowling. Still playing it slow? Ketchup slow. Glacier slow. Continental drift slow. - So slow? - I'm saying. Hey, listen. About this living without sex thing. I was hoping you can give me a little advice. Me? What would make you think of me? Well, I figure you get laid less often than a boil-covered dwarf, am I right? I don't have the actual statistics, but go on. Well, you must get really frustrated. I mean, how do you stop yourself from, you know running a red light and then taunting the cop till he shoots you? Good question. I've found that the best thing to do is to focus on your career get a hobby, become involved in community activities and at the end of the day, if you have any energy left find a quiet space and yank it like a monkey in a mango tree. Interesting. What kind of hobbies are we talking about? Well, I tried collecting stamps, building model trains but in the end, all roads led back up the mango tree. That's what I was afraid of. Hey, where are you going? I'm gonna go get in my car run a red light and hope for a clean headshot. The great thing about this piece is that it fuses a classical score with jazz choreography. On a counter programming note, the Lakers are playing Miami tonight. - Would you rather watch that? - No, no, this is fine. Of course, I don't have a $500 bet down on the ballet. - What channel? - No, seriously, this is Channel 2. Charlie, you don't have to give up things that you like just because of me. Oh, okay, great. Good to know. Hey, as long as we're on that subject there's something I wanna run past you. - Go ahead. - Let me just preface it by saying that I am for holding off on sex so our relationship can develop more, you know, deepness. I'm glad. I think it's working too. We were getting closer than we would, had we just jumped into bed together. Good. Sounds like we're on the same page. And just to make sure we don't jump the gun I was thinking it'd be a good idea if I had an outlet that, you know, took the pressure off. - An outlet? - Yeah, an outlet. Something casual, meaningless. If I work it right, it could even be anonymous. - You mean another woman? - Well, that would be my first choice. But for the purposes of this discussion, let's stay with the term, "Outlet. " I don't care what you call it. You're asking for permission to have sex with another woman. Only because I care about you too much to whore around without permission. Are you crazy? I can't go back to the mango tree, Mia. What? Look, I think this is a mature, thoughtful suggestion. In fact, there are many cultures that embrace the whole outlet concept as a way of strengthening and nurturing the primary love relationship. - You can't dismiss entire cultures with: - I'm going home. Oh, come on, we're just talking here. I propose an idea, then we compromise. That's the cornerstone of a relationship. How are we gonna compromise? Are you gonna have sex with half a woman? Is that an option? What's going on? - We had our first fight. - Oh, what about? I suggested that as long as we weren't having sex it'd be good for our relationship if I had sex with somebody else. And she didn't buy that? Wouldn't even discuss it. Women, huh? They say they wanna talk, but they don't wanna talk. What's the matter with Uncle Charlie? He's down because he had a fight with his girlfriend. - That's too bad. - Hey, why don't you go talk to him. - Maybe you can cheer him up. - How? I don't know. Tell him a joke. Okay. Might as well just give him a bowl of Milky Ways. Hey, Uncle Charlie, what's green, has four legs and would kill you if it fell out of a tree and landed on you? - What? - A pool table. It's funny because you wouldn't expect it to be in a tree. Nothing. Okay, I'll talk to him. Hey, if you can work up a fart, ask him to pull your finger. - Hey. - Hey. - Still haven't heard from Mia? - She won't return my calls. You do realize that suggesting to have sex with other women was a monumentally stupid thing to do. Yes, Alan, I realize it. The question now, is how do I apologize? You mean grovel. No, I mean apologize with my dignity and pride intact. Oh, you sad, naive fool. If marriage taught me anything it's that there is no apologizing without groveling. - Mia and I aren't married. - Are you having sex? Continue. First of all, the phone's no good. You must grovel in person. Humiliation is a visual medium. - Okay. - Next, don't go empty-handed. But keep in mind that any gifts you offer may end up being thrown at your head. Flowers, lingerie, jewelry, all good. Picture frames, waffle irons, steak knives, not so much. You actually bought your wife a waffle iron? I was young. She liked waffles. Anyway, the most important thing is sincerity. - Sincerity? - Y es. You absolutely must be able to fake sincerity. You know what? I've underestimated you. You are far more deceitful than I've given you credit for. - Thank you. - No, I was faking sincerity. Oh, it's very good. But all kidding aside, I really appreciate your help. - Well, you're welcome. - Got you again. That's That was good. - Oh, hey, can you do me a favor? - What's that? Pull my finger. - You're bluffing. - Try me? Wait, give me another chance. I though I had one. - Hi. - Hi. - These are for you. - You didn't have to do that. Really? My brother said I did. Well, thank him for me. Come on in. I just want you to know how sorry I am. Actually, I think I owe you an apology. - You do? - Yeah, these are for you. You didn't have to do that. I shouldn't have gotten so angry with you. Not to say that your "outlet" idea wasn't incredibly juvenile, selfish, moronic I accept your apology. The point is, is that I really don't have any right to object to you sleeping with other women. We don't have a commitment. You're free to do whatever. Thanks. That's great. Very mature. - So everything's okay now? - No, you ass. If we keep seeing each other, I want a commitment. - Commitment? - Yes, a commitment. Does that mean we can have sex? Is that the only reason you'd be willing to make a commitment? It's in the top two. Well, I think sex should wait until we get our relationship on track. Okay, okay. Let me make sure I understand this. You want me to make a commitment that I will not have sex with anyone at the same time I'm not having sex with you? Yes. All right, let's come at this from another angle. We're gonna be sexually exclusive, but without the sex? Well, I suppose you could look at it that way. So bottom line no sex for Charlie with you or anyone else for the foreseeable future. Correct. Are you insane? If you care about us, it should be something that you wanna do. What are you giving up? - The same thing. - You wanna sleep with other guys? - Of course not. - Then you're giving up nothing. Tell you what, I'll give up sex. You give up, I don't know, a kidney. Come on, don't be stupid. - Okay, okay, dancing. - Dancing's my life, Charlie. Now we have a level playing field. You know what, maybe you should just go. Right, why stay here when I can just as easily not have sex with you in the comfort of my home? Oh, go to hell. See? That's why you didn't get a waffle iron. Hey, how did it go with Mia? - Great. We broke up. - How is that great? Now I can go back to being who I really am. And who's that? Somebody who doesn't care who he really is. Someone who just has fun. I see. Someone who spends his life in a drunken haze having meaningless sex with strangers. If you knew who I am, why'd you ask? Hurry, Charlie. I'm starting to sober up. Well, we can't have that. No. You might find out who she is. - Here you go. - Good. Boy, I haven't been this drunk since I took my SATs. Doesn't seem to have held you back. No, just one year. Sixth grade. Charlie? You okay? Yeah, I just got a lot on my mind. Do you wanna look at my boobs? - No, thanks. - Are you sure? It always cheers me up. Oh, Mia. Hi. Is Charlie here? - Tickle, tickle. - Cut it out. That was great, do it again. Alan, don't you think it's time you kept your girlfriend company? - My what? - Thanks for playing along. Oh, yes, my My girlfriend. Yes, excuse me. Coming, pookie. - Well, this is an awkward moment. - You are such a schmuck. Okay, the ice is broken. - Goodbye, Charlie. - Oh, come on. We don't have a commitment. We don't have a relationship. You know, you're right. Go back to your bimbo. Hey, hey, hey. She's not a bimbo. I'm not saying she's a brain surgeon. No, wait, Mia. At least tell me why you came. You wanna know why? I came because after I cooled down I started to miss you and I wanted to make love. - That's great. It's wonderful. - And it's not gonna happen. Why? Because of that bimbo? Let me tell you something. The entire time I was fooling around with her, I was thinking of you. Oh, swell. You know what I mean. I would trade a hundred of her for one of you. You're ready to make a commitment? Yes. Maybe you want some time to think about it? How could that help? Look, I don't wanna be with anybody but you so I might as well be committed. Yes, you should. - You wanna go upstairs? - Not right now. Oh, please don't tell me you've got somebody in your room. No, no, no. No. If we're gonna do this commitment thing the first time should be really special. What have you got in mind? Well, you know. Candles, music and maybe not having the girl I was trying to rebound with dancing half naked on the deck with my idiot brother. - Are you sure? - Oh, yeah. He's an idiot. Call me later. Well, back to the mango tree. What is this? A healthy cereal that won't rot your teeth. You got that right, because I'm not eating it. That's all you're getting. - Morning. - Morning. - Morning. - Is he in a better mood today? Yeah. Uncle Charlie, I got another joke for you. - Okay. - There's two muffins sitting side by side in a muffin tin in the oven. One muffin says, "Boy, it's hot in here. " And the other one says, "Holy crap, a talking muffin. " I just don't think he knows what's funny. SDl Media Group   





                    			This is such a beautiful sunset. Thanks. Thanks? You're taking credit for the sunset? No, not Not the sunset per se. But I did buy a house on the beach so we can stand here and watch the sunset so thanks. Your house works with a lot of women, doesn't it? Honestly, it's like a G-spot with two mortgages. Just so you know, I'm not with you for your house or your money. So it's the car. Why would I care about your car? It's an $80,000 Mercedes. Yeah, so? What does it do that other cars don't do? It costs $80,000. Hey, I almost forgot. I have something for you. Charlie, you don't have to buy me expensive jewelry. Okay, nothing but cheap crap from now on. It's beautiful. Read the inscription. "One month, two weeks, four days. " What does it mean? Well, since we decided to go ahead and consummate our relationship finally I thought I should honor the time we've already spent together. Exclusively. In a committed relationship. Without any sex whatsoever. So unless we have sex before midnight you're gonna need to buy a new bracelet? You're pretty sure of yourself. Well, since you went to all the trouble to engrave it Don't even ask what I used as a chisel. - Kandi. - Hello, Alan. Is Charlie available? Because I wish to speak with him. Okay, why don't you just wait here and I'll let him know. I would be immensely appreciative if you would. Alrighty. What the hell does this mean? - I was sending you a message. - What? That you're a woman trapped in a man's body? - Kandi's here. - And you want me to call you Kandi? No, Kandi, the girl you were seeing before Mia. She's been calling here for days. It's time you let her know you're with another woman. Yeah, Charlie, after all it's been "one month, two weeks, four days. " Did you know that Alan's a woman trapped in a man's body? So you gonna go talk to your ex-girlfriend? Okay, first of all, sweetheart she's not really an ex-girlfriend. Her name's Kandi. Thanks, Alan. With a K. - Alan. - And an I. So if Kandi with a K and an I isn't your ex-girlfriend, then what is she? Well, I I I would say she's more of a person who would drop by from time to time and Yeah, that. Why haven't you told this person that you're in a relationship? Her name's Kandi. Boy, you're on thin ice. I think we both know why you didn't tell her. Well, if that's the case, then this discussion is moot. We should go upstairs while Alan goes back and lies about my whereabouts. Well, I'm not half the liar you are, but I'll give it a shot. Shall we go upstairs and continue this conversation? Are you out of your freaking mind? Okay, you're mad, I get that. - So? - Well, Kandi, it's like this. Charlie's with another woman. Don't lie to me, Alan. Okay. He's in Africa working as a scrub nurse for Doctors Without Borders. Story of my life. That's the story of your life? It's not always a scrub nurse but it's always Africa. Before you say anything, I want you to know I've anticipated problems like this. Look on the other side of the bracelet. "I'm very, very sorry. " Problem is, Charlie, that you don't believe in this relationship. Not believe in it? It's kept me from having sex for over six weeks. It would be like not believing in a serious groin pull. - You know what Kandi is? - I try not to judge. She's a lifeboat. You're keeping a lifeboat for when this ship sinks. Hey, hey, hey, lifeboats don't mean you expect the ship to sink. The relationship, if I may. What they mean is that you have a healthy respect for the power of the sea. Are you listening to yourself? Y eah, I just caught the last part. Not well thought out. No. All my life guys have looked at me like I'm just some kind of sex toy. Well, they're wrong. Yeah, just because you're good at something doesn't mean you should be pigeonholed. And the only reason I'm so good at it is because I practice. Of course, all the practice in the world isn't gonna help if you don't love what you're doing. What do you want me to do, Mia? Call every woman I've known to announce I'm now in a relationship? Hi, Shirley, this is Charlie Harper. We met at Disneyland about 22 years ago. Yeah, Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. That was me. Anyway, I thought you should know I have a girlfriend now. So I'd appreciate it if you didn't call me. Okay, bye-bye. Well, that takes care of Shirley. Now, what about Kandi? You want me to tell her? Fine. I'll tell her. I'll go tell her right now. But before I cut her loose completely let me float a crazy idea by you. Sort of a win, win, win. Are you out of your freaking mind? It was worth a shot. Kandi, before you say anything, I want you to know I'm in a committed relationship now and I'm really in love with this woman. She's the best thing that's happened to me and I can't imagine being with anyone else. Now, sweetheart. Don't cry. I'm sure you'll find someone else. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. What? I thought we were going upstairs. Okay, you're still mad. I get that. - I made your bed. - Thank you. It's been real easy lately. How nice for you. You haven't even been flying solo, have you? That's a little personal. Hey, you want privacy, wash your own sheets. Once I get my mitts on them, they're in the public domain. - Good morning. - Morning. - How did it go with Mia last night? - Based on his laundry, not well. - Why don't you tell the neighbors? - Where do you think I'm going? By the way, thanks for getting rid of Kandi for me. Hey, I'm your brother. I got your back. Good to know. Hey, as long as we're on the subject, I was wondering. Since you're swimming in Lake Monogamy, as it were would you mind if I, you know -  asked Kandi out sometime? - Go for it. - Just wanted to make sure you're okay. - I'm fine. - Don't want you to feel weird. - Thanks for your consideration. Morning, Huggy Bear. So, Kandi, wanna go out sometime? Okay, I want you to know I tracked down Kandi. I told her to move on and she has. So I got no lifeboats, no life preservers, no water wings. If the ship goes down, I'm going down with it. So there's no longer any reason to put off you and me getting naked. Charlie, I'd like you to meet my parents. Hello. What if Dad says I could stay up to watch it? He won't. How do you know? Your father and I talk, so don't try to play us against each other. I gotta try, it's what I do. Hi. Hello. Is Alan here? Father Huggy Bear. Yes, my child? - You've got company. - Alan? - Stall them, stall them, stall them. - Okay. You must be Jake. And you must be Jake's grandma. Judith, hi. Go watch some cartoons. - Okay. - Cool. - Are you proud of yourself? - What do you mean? Oh, please, she has to be half your age. Oh, that. Yeah, I am pretty proud of that. What could you possibly have in common? - What do you talk about? - Talk? T o tell you the truth, we haven't really done a lot of talking. I mean, I did hear her confession. She's been a very bad girl. I'm supposed to leave Jake here? What kind of message does that send him? I don't know. Dreams can come true. Life is beautiful. There is a God. Hey, Judith. Father. I suppose you're the one that introduced Alan to that slutty little Don't say it, Judith. You'll just be demeaning all women. And yes. Figures. Well, I don't want her around my son. Oh, really? So do I get to screen the men that you're dating? Let's not forget about the guy who delivered the truckload of sod. - What about him? - It doesn't take two months to put down a new lawn, Judith. Sounds like she got laid before the sod did. I'm not gonna dignify that with a response. Watch out for crab grass. So, what's Kandi, a nun? Catholic school girl. Oh, excellent choice. Oh, hey, how? How are things with Mia? Not bad. She forgives me. Introduced me to her parents. Oh, yeah? How did that go? Well, you know, those things are always awkward. The big news is I'm taking Mia to the Bel Air Hotel tonight where we will express our love in the way that we were meant to. - Drunk and in a hurry? - You got it. - How's the caviar? - It's perfect. Everything's perfect. - Would you like a fire? - Don't go to any trouble. It's no trouble. Luckily I was a Boy Scout in Beverly Hills. - Champagne? - No, thanks. I wanna be completely present for the first time we make love. Good for you. Don't you want to be present? Well, within reason. Come on. What do you say we save the champagne? But I already opened it. Do you need alcohol to make love to me? No, no. I don't need it. Well, then. Is something wrong? I don't know. I mean, we didn't hop into bed on the first date. We've gotten to know each other. We're not drinking. It's all so new to me. That's what makes it special. I just don't want either of us to be disappointed because one of us might not be throwing their A-game tonight. - Are you nervous? - No, no. Of course not. But, you know, of the two of us, only one can fake an A-game. There's nothing that you could do to disappoint me tonight. No, no, it's what I can't do that might disappoint you. You just relax. I'll be right back. Okay. Why don't you put some music on? Okay. - Should I ask? - I wish you wouldn't. I'm not supposed to play this because my mom says it's too violent. It has to be violent. You can't negotiate with zombies. - Don't tell me, tell her. - I don't think she likes me. She doesn't really like anybody. Except the guy who keeps putting grass in our backyard. Okay, time for bed. - Just a little longer. - I'm not sleepy. No, him. I get to stay up. - That's not fair. - Jake. Just because she's a girl. - Wanna play? - Oh, no, thanks. I I thought maybe we could just talk. Hang on. Let me just saw off this zombie's head. Good Lord. There we go. Now, let me save my work. Okay, all done. Wanna have sex? Actually, I do. But maybe we could spend a little time getting to know each other first. All right. What do you wanna know? Well, do you have any brothers or sisters? I do not. How about you? Well, Charlie. Oh, right, Charlie. - Do you like to read? - Oh, yeah, I love reading. Oh, great, great, me too. Read anything good lately? You mean like books and magazines not billboards and text messages, right? - Yeah. - Then, no. Do menus count? Are you ready for me? Mia, if I were any more ready, I'd be done. Oh, jeez, I'm sorry. You okay? - I think so. - Are you sure? Yeah, I'm fine. Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah. But I think that's enough foreplay. You see, the thing for me was that I never should have gotten married. I was young, I didn't know who I was. And to be completely honest, I was just afraid of being alone. Can I share something with you? Y es, please. This is communicating, this is how we connect. You shouldn't tell people that stuff, it makes you sound like a loser. No, it makes me sound like a real human being. A person with feelings and flaws. Loser. - Why don't we just go have sex? - Finally. Oh, cheer up. It wasn't that bad. There were parts of it that I liked. Can we please not go over the game film now? - What's the big deal? - What's the big deal? This is supposed to be the part that I'm good at. You are. It was fine. I don't wanna hear fine. I wanna see the top of your head blow off. It's not a carnival game. The object is not to swing your mallet and ring my bell. Well, we disagree. That's just your ego talking. Charlie, listen to me. I love you, not your money or car or your house or your skills in bed. What's left? - Charlie. - Oh, come on. Come on. You're saying that if I was some pencil-weenie guy living in a shack and taking the bus to my job selling oranges on the freeway off-ramp -  you'd still love me? - Yes, I would still love you. - Okay, I understand now. - Good. You're insane. Why? Because I love the real you? No, no, because you think there is a real me. Would you believe I love you if my eyes had rolled back and my head had blown off? It would be a start. All right. I guess we're just gonna have to try again. Hang on. Hang on. How am I gonna know you're not faking it? If I was gonna fake it, don't you think I would have done it the first time? Fair enough. - Hey, wanna hear something amusing? - Always. According to my girlfriend underneath all the superficial, cool stuff in my life there's actually a real me. - No kidding? - Apparently, he's quite a guy. I'd like to meet him sometime. Don't hold your breath. My girlfriend, on the other hand, has no idea who I really am damn little desire to find out and is only interested in riding me like a mustang and draining me of all bodily fluids. How do you feel about that? I think I love her. You know what love isn't blind, it's retarded. SDl Media Group   





                    			You know what I've been thinking about? - What? - The death penalty. Really? That's a That's a very complex issue. So So, what are your thoughts? If you're going to the chair they give you what you want for your last meal. I guess. - I'm gonna order cereal. - Why? Because if you keep adding milk you can make it last forever. And they just gotta wait. Okay, let's go back a bit. Why would you be going to the chair in the first place? I don't know. My DNA shows up at a murder scene because it's planted by a crooked cop or maybe one of my teachers. - So you'd be wrongly accused? - Story of my life, Dad. Remember that water pistol incident at school? But that was your water pistol. Yes, but it wasn't my pee. Morning. Oh, hey, how was your run? Great. We made it all the way to the pier and back. Didn't we, honey? Yeah. Pier. Back. Hey, Jake, you ever seen anybody cough up blood? - Nope. - Then pay attention. - Ass. - Ass? Kiss. My. Sweaty. I think I'll jump in the shower. Wanna join me? Can't. Later. Maybe. All right. Well, you drink your health shake, all right? - You'll feel better. - Doubt it. - What's in that? - I don't know. Vitamins, minerals, protein. Whatever it is, it's flushing out stuff I ate in high school. Hey, do you think they let you have a last poop after your last meal? What? Because as long as you're sitting on the can technically you're still pooping. And they gotta wait. Go get dressed. If they made you hold one in, that'd be cruel and unusual punishment. You know, I am impressed with what you're doing here. Exercising, eating right, laying off the cigars and the booze. I mean, Mia has really done wonders with you. - Y eah, she's an incredible woman. - She is. - And I'm a lucky guy. - You are. Why is there this little voice in my head that keeps whispering, "Kill yourself. Do it now. " Don't worry about that. It's common. - Really? - Oh, yeah. Every man who gets into a long-term, committed relationship hears that voice. Mine sounded a little like Alec Baldwin. I don't know why. Maybe because I enjoyed him in that submarine movie. - What was that call? - Would you get to the point? You have to remember that over time that voice will fade when you realize what you're giving up is nothing compared to what you're gaining. What exactly am I gaining? Are you kidding? You're gaining a soul mate. Someone to walk down life's path with you. Someone who'll always be there, sharing your hopes your joys and your sorrows. You got nothing. That's what the minister said at my wedding. Hunt for Red October. Be back in a while, honey. I'm going for a power walk. - Pace yourself. - Don't worry. This is a good pace. Hey. What you doing? Nothing. Close the damn door. You told Mia you weren't gonna smoke or drink anymore. You told your father you weren't gonna watch dirty movies on cable anymore. Don't change the subject. Mia's gonna be really pissed at you. Only if she finds out and she doesn't have to find out. Well, I guess that depends. What, are you blackmailing me? No. I'm just saying if you don't give me 20 bucks I'm gonna tell on you. That's blackmail. Well, then, yeah. - Oh, hi, Mom, how are you? - Deeply hurt. Is this about me or Charlie? - Charlie. - Great. Come on in. Can you explain to me how your brother can be in a serious relationship and not only have I not met the woman he hasn't even bothered to tell me her name? Do you really need an explanation for that? Do you want it to be about you? - Her name's Mia. She's in the kitchen. - Thank you. Thank God I didn't know Anne Frank. Hello. Hello. - I'm Evelyn, Charlie's mother. - I'm Mia, Charlie's girlfriend. - So we finally meet. - So we do. One question. - I'm listening. - Can you fix him? I'm trying. Fifteen, 16, 17, 18 Jake? How about a hug for your grandmommy? No, thank you. One, two What the hell are you doing? Hey, hey, hey. Keep it down. Keep it down. Mia thinks I'm taking a power walk. This is a sad, sad day. I always figured you'd be the last guy in the world to end up whipped. I am not whipped. I'm considerate. - Considerate? - Yeah. See, I love Mia and want her to be happy. I happen to know she's not happy when I smoke cigars and drink and gamble and stay out all night and eat meat and sugar and grease and fat and nap and swear and wear shorts and bowling shirts Charlie, you ain't just whipped, you're roped, saddled and gelded. They could use you to give rides at kid's birthday parties. - I am not whipped. - Yeah. Here, might as well take one of these sacks since yours is empty. Hang on a second. - That ain't gonna do it, Alice. - What? You smell like a beer bottle that just fell out of Joe Camel's ass. Well, what am I supposed to do? Oh, hang on, let's see if I got anything in here that might mask your stench. Oven cleaner. No. Ty-D-Bol. No. How do you feel about taking a whore's bath with a hunk of blue cheese? I'm so proud of him. He hasn't had a drop of alcohol in weeks. Well, that's one way to go. But I've found that men who drink tend to talk less and sleep more. Which, frankly, becomes increasingly desirable as the years go by. Oh, this can't be good. Hello, darling. Wonderful to see you. Hi, Mom. Have you been dusting? - No, why? - You reek of Lemon Pledge. You're welcome. I'll be downstairs. No snacking, Charlie. We're going to the best vegetarian restaurant in town. Oh, boy. Oh, thank God. Meat. - I love you, Rose. - I love you too, Charlie. And may I say, I would never try to change you the way she has. - Her name's Mia. - I know what her name is. I also know where she lives, her employment history and if you want I can get you photographs of a wet T -shirt contest she entered during spring break 1995 at a college bar called Senor Frogs. I forgot who I'm dealing with. I know you have to hide to smoke a cigar and slam back a warm beer. What'd you do, bug my garage? Don't be paranoid. I have a long-standing arrangement with Jake. Charlie, I'm ready. I'm out here. Go, go, go. Okay, I'll go, but I want you to remember one thing. - What? - I'm not gonna wait for you forever. How do I look? How's your couscous? Yum, yum. I had an interesting chat with your mom today. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I know she comes on a little strong but her heart's in the right place. If you mean in a cooler on its way to a dying man in Tennessee, then we agree. - You can't possibly mean that. - I suppose not. She's too selfish to donate an organ. Even one she doesn't use. That's so unfair, Charlie. Your mother loves you. Really? Did she or did she not say I was a bitter disappointment? - Well, she did, but - And did she or did she not say that I'm a lazy-ass schlock jingle writer who wasted 13 years of piano lessons that she paid for by marrying a series of men with large wallets and small penises? Yes, that was mentioned. It's natural for someone who loves you to want to see you live to your potential. Do you want to be known as the guy who writes songs about adult diapers? Hey, it's better than being known as the guy who wears them. Charlie, we both know you can do so much more with your life. Maybe. But you gotta admire my restraint. Oh, come on, look how much you've accomplished since we've been together. You're exercising regularly, you cut way down on the drinking and you're eating right. Did you ever think you'd change your life the way you have? Never. It just goes to show, you can do anything you put your mind to. I smell meat. Excuse me? Your breath. It stinks of meat. Well, it could be my tongue. My tongue is meat. No, you've been eating meat. I can smell it. Maybe it's this breast of Tofurky you smell. - No, I smell beef. - Where would I get beef? You tell me. Well, maybe it's secondhand beef. - What? - You know, like secondhand smoke. Some thoughtless guy who's sitting next to you eating a steak can Oh, screw it. I paid a slightly disturbed woman to toss a bag of cheeseburgers onto the deck while you were getting dressed. - Oh, Charlie. - Don't "Oh, Charlie" me, I was starving. And I'll tell you another thing, my power walk was two quick beers and half a Cuban cigar while cowering in my own garage. That's why you smelt like Lemon Pledge. Well, it certainly wasn't to bring out the natural luster of my forehead. So you've been lying to me? If you mean telling you I wasn't going to do a bunch of things then doing them anyway and lying about it, then I've been lying to you. Well, I suppose I can forgive you. If you promise it'll never happen again. Oh, it'll never happen again. You know why? Because I am done with this whole charade. I'm tired of you trying to make me over into something I'm not. I'm a grown man, not a work in progress. - Charlie, people are staring. - Let them stare. You guys know what I mean. Why can't women look at a guy for who he is instead of who they can turn him into? - Please, you're embarrassing me. - Good. Maybe now you know how I feel. Sitting in a restaurant eating medallions of bean curd with lawn mower sauce. Am I right? No man should have to eat anything with the word "curd" in it. You know, you're turning into a real ass here. Well, then I'm finally living up to my potential. I'm a big old bourbon-soaked, cigar-huffing ass as God, in his infinite wisdom, meant me to be. As he meant all men to be. You guys are disappointing God. Okay, what if a cannibal was on death row? I guess for being a cannibal. And he orders Chinese for his last meal, does he get to eat a Chinese guy? No. What if they just electrocuted a Chinese guy and the cannibal was next? No. - He'd already be cooked. - Stop it. - Hey. - Hey, where have you been? - I had a date with Mia. - That was two nights ago. Yeah, well, I stopped off in Vegas on the way home. Why? Because that's where you go after you destroy a relationship. Oh, now I understand why Mia's been calling. - She sounded pretty upset. - I didn't tell her anything. But you'd tell Rose, wouldn't you? Hey, you just paid me once. Rose has me on something called a "retainer. " - So, what happened with Mia? - No big deal. I just got tired of trying to be something I'm not. - A decent, healthy human being? - Pretty much. He's back. You're damn right I'm back. Mia and I are through. You schmuck. She was the best thing that ever happened to you. But you said I was whipped. I didn't mean dump her, I meant grow a pair. What is "whipped"? When a man lets a woman take over his life and tell him what to do. Oh, so like you and Mom. No. Oh, hi, Mother. No, no, Mia's not here. He broke up with her. Yeah, schmuck seems to be the general consensus. - What's a "schmuck"? - Any guy who's not whipped. - She wants to talk to you. - Well, I don't wanna talk to her. Nice catch, schmuck. Hi, Mom. Why am I the bad guy here? Well, did you ever stop to consider that maybe this wasn't my fault? I gotta go, Mom, my meat connection's here. It's just weird. I just think that if the guy's got a front door, we should use it. - This is fine. - Okay. - Hi, Charlie. - Hello, Rose. What's going on? Well, I just wanted to introduce you to Gordon, my new boyfriend. Oh, no kidding. Hi, Gordon. Hello. Gordon and I are in a committed relationship. - Right, Gordon? - Yeah, I guess. Look, see, there's stairs right over there. Just Anyway I was thinking that you and Mia would like to join us for dinner one night. You know, double date. Oh, well, that's nice, Rose, but I broke up with Mia. Oh, I see. Well, then goodbye, Gordon. I think I made a big mistake. I know the feeling. I once ate an egg salad sandwich I left in my desk over the weekend. Huge mistake. My relationship with Mia was the best thing that happened to me and I threw it away. That's what I should have done with the sandwich. I wonder if it's too late to fix things. Call her and find out. But if I do, I'll be right back where I started trying to be somebody I'm not. Okay, then find another girlfriend. I don't want another girlfriend. I want Mia. Then call her. I can't. I can't live with her, I can't live without her. If your plane crashed in the Andes and she died, could you eat her? Mia, it's Charlie. Look, you win. I'll change. No more meat, I promise. Come on, Mia. Come out and smell me. Mia's not here. Do I have to smell you? - Who are you? - Ginger. So you're Charlie. - Yeah, where's Mia? - Hang on a minute. She told me to give you this if you stopped by. She took a job in New York? Why'd she do that? Just read the note. "I love you too much to try to make you into something you're not and I love me too much to settle for who you are. " That's the part that always makes me cry. I can change her mind. I'll fly to New York tonight. - Do you have her address? - Come on in. - Can I get you something to drink? - No, thanks. Hi, American Airlines, reservations please. You sure? I got all my boys here. Jack, Johnnie and Jose. Maybe a poquito Jose. Are these actual baby back ribs? - Yeah, help yourself. - Thanks. I'd like to make a reservation on the redeye to New Y ork tonight. Hey, do you mind if I turn on the TV? I've got some money on the Lakers. - You bet sports? - I'll bet anything. I had 200 bucks on my sister's pregnancy test. How exactly do you know Mia? Oh, we used to do the ballet thing together but I didn't have the discipline. - No kidding. - I still dance, but just for tips. I'll call you back. You know, I'm thinking she probably needs her space. Probably. - Mind if I hang out and watch the game? - Be my guest. If you got cash, I could give you a lap dance at halftime. That'd be swell.

                    			- Morning. - Morning. - What are you making? - Breakfast. Have you considered orange juice and a piece of toast? It's in there. We got any marshmallows? And he wonders why he gets diarrhea. Oh, man. Did you forget to put the lid on again? Maybe. - Well, clean it up. - Okay. - Is Jake up yet? - He's in the kitchen. - Has he been looking for me? - Are you a marshmallow? - What? - He hasn't been looking for you. Oh, good. Sorry I'm late, but Kandi and I had morning sex. - Good for you. - Twice. Congratulations. She didn't even wake me up for the first one. I almost missed it. Well, I've always said a 22-year-old girl is like a good carpenter. No wood gets wasted. Well, I wouldn't put it so crudely, but yeah. - Morning, buddy. - Morning. Why do you let him use the blender? I'm hoping he'll eventually stumble into a margarita. Hey, here's a fun fact. You're sleeping with a girl who was born when you were in junior high. And yet there's a good chance she lost her virginity before you did. And here's another fun fact. I'll bet she's had sex with more girls than you too. That is a fun fact. And you know what else? Her youth is like an aphrodisiac. I feel younger, I feel more Oh, I don't know how to describe it. Manly. I know what you mean. I'm performing at what can only be described as a very enhanced level. - Right. - You know, between-the-sheets-wise. - You don't have to tell me. - Yes, I do. I have to tell everybody. I'm just impressed you can keep up with her. I thought she'd have worn you down to a few vertebrae in a pool of spinal fluid. Well, you know, I exercise, I eat right And of course, I've always had a vast, untapped reservoir of sexual energy bubbling under the surface. Truth be told, you could drill anywhere and hit a gusher. Morning, brother. We're here to tell you about The Good News. Okay, but my news first. See, I am dating this 22-year-old woman. Incredible. - Hey, Charlie. - Hey, Rose, what's up? I was taking a walk on the beach with my boyfriend and we thought we'd stop by. Come on up, lamb chop. This is ridiculous. I still don't understand why we can't use the stairs over there. - Don't try to change me, Gordon. - I'm sorry. So how's it going with you two? It's just great. Gordon's my soul mate. - He completes me. We're inseparable. - Yeah. Wait here. I wanna talk to Charlie alone. - Charlie. - Coming. - Lamb chop? - I'm hot and juicy. - What's up? - Don't play innocent with me. - I can see the hurt in your eyes. - What? - You have to let me go, Charlie. - Okay. - I'm with Gordon now. I've moved on. - Good. And I know it may be hard for you to hear this but he satisfies all my needs. Well, he is hot and juicy. Oh, Charlie. I can't bear to see you like this. Like what? I know I shouldn't but I'm gonna give you one last chance. One last chance for what? You're gonna make me say it, aren't you? Say what? Listen closely. Once I go, I'm gone. Really? I've never seen that side of you. I've never had a man like Gordon. I believe you. - So? - "So," what? - Who's that? - Oh, that's Gordon, my boyfriend. How come he's not allowed in? I'm trying to avoid an awkward situation. - Too late. - You bringing him to my birthday party? What do you think, Charlie? Is the wound too fresh? I think I can handle it. Cool. - Okay. I'm gonna go now. - All right. But before I do I think we need to decide just where we stand. - You're kidding. Rose has a boyfriend? - Yep. A real one, or, like, Toby the astronaut? No, this one's real. - What's he like? - Nice guy. He has no idea how close he is to the woodchipper. - Hello? Alan, you home? - Kandi? What are you doing here? I thought I'd surprise you with a booty call. - Lower your voice. - Booty call. What's a booty call? Well, it's You know, this is more the kind of thing a son should learn from his father. Oh, okay. Maybe you should ask him now. All right. I'm going to hell. Look, it's a really sweet gesture, but this is not a great time. Hey, Dad, what's a booty call? Oh, hey. Hey, Jake. You You remember Kandi. - Sure. Hi, Kandi. - Hi. So, what's a booty call? I figured you didn't want me telling him. Was I wrong? Well, Jake, it means that Kandi came by to do her laundry. I don't see any laundry. Good point, Charlie. Always the eye for detail. Well, you see, Jake in the Old West cowboys could be out on the dusty range for months at a time. And they'd get mighty dirty. So they'd They'd mosey into town with nothing but the clothes on their backs. And they'd need to wash them. So, what they'd do is they would go down to the creek and strip down until they were wearing nothing but their boots. Why'd they keep their boots on? Rattlesnakes. Anyway, in order to warn people who were swimming that, you know, the naked cowboy was on his way he would yell, or, if you will, call: "Booty. Booty. " Ergo, the booty call. Alan, you really make history fun. Well, thank you. So when did it start meaning "casual sex"? Why don't you go play a video game or something? - Okay. - Great. Hey, Kandi, you wanna come to my birthday party tomorrow? - Sure. How old are you gonna be? - Twelve. Happy bar mitzvah. Well, this works out well. When you're not boinking her, she's got someone to play with. Weren't you listening? Jake just invited Kandi to his birthday party. Oh, don't worry. You've still got the inside track. No. - I can't let her come to the party. - Why not? Why not? My ex-wife is gonna be there. All her miserable, middle-aged soccer-mom friends are gonna be there. They're gonna take one look at Kandi's tight, young little body and they are gonna hate me, hate me with a white-hot hatred of burning hate. Yeah, sure, it'll be a little tense at first but you can lighten the mood with your booty story. That's powerful funny, partner. Shut up. Alan, there comes a time in every man's life when he has to make a choice. Does he wanna be loved or does he wanna get laid? Fourteen years ago you made the wrong choice. You got married. And you wound up with neither. But now, now fate has given you another chance. Welcome it. Embrace it. Grab its pert little ass. What am I supposed to do, walk into my son's birthday and say: "Hey, look at this gorgeous 22-year-old woman I'm having sex with"? Oh, don't be silly. You don't wanna rub their faces in it. You just want them to know where yours has been. - Oh, yeah, one more thing. - Yeah? Booty. Booty. Uncle Charlie? Uncle Charlie, are you awake? Go away. Don't you wanna be the first one to wish me a happy birthday? - Jake, I swear to God - Wait, not yet. Five, four, three, two, one. Okay, now. Get out. You can give me your present now if you want to. If you leave immediately, I'll give you the gift of life. All right. - Hey, how come Dad's not in his room? - He's out with Kandi. - When's he coming home? - Not for a while. Why doesn't he just have sex with her here? What makes you think he's having sex with her? I don't know, common sense? All right. The thing is, he's embarrassed about having that kind of relationship with somebody so much younger than him. Why? I don't know, maybe he thinks he's setting a bad example for you. What am I gonna do, start dating a 6-year-old? - Go back to sleep. - I can't. I'm too excited. Well, you mind if I go back to sleep? - Okay. I'll find something to do. - Great. - Maybe I'll try to make a pizza. - Good for you. Oh, crap. Pierre? Have you seen Pierre? - Is Pierre a cat? - Yeah. - Bathroom. - Thanks. Excuse me. - Hey. - Hey. Oh, God. Still worth it. Hey, I'm watching that. Yeah, right. Happy birthday, you big dope. - Why am I a big dope? - When did you finally fall asleep? How could I possibly know that? Now you got a party in a couple hours and you feel like hell, right? - Yeah. - Happy birthday, you big dope. Hey, am I old enough to have coffee now? Do you still think armpit farts are funny? - Yeah. - Then no. Come on, I could really use a pick-me-up. - Okay, how do you want it? - I don't know, in a cup? Good choice. - You feel better? - Yeah, I think it's working. You know, Kandi, you don't have to feel obligated to go to this party. It's just gonna be a lot of kids playing silly games. Are there gonna be balloon animals? Because I love those. No, Jake's a little old for that. Balloon animals are a very underappreciated art form, Alan. Just give me a minute to get ready. Okay. You know, it's probably gonna be a very, very dull party. I wouldn't be going myself if I weren't related to the kid. And without balloon animals, you gotta ask yourself: "Is it really worth the trip? " How do I look? I'm I'm sorry, I think I swallowed my tongue. Thank you. It's amazing. My ex-wife would take hours getting ready and the end result wouldn't be nearly so this. Maybe I can give her a few tips at the party. Oh, gee. - She doesn't respond well to tips. - Okay. Anything else? Well even before I say it, I know it sounds insane but do you think you could put on a few more clothes? - Don't I look okay? - Oh, yeah, yeah, you look terrific. It's just, I wouldn't want people to get the wrong idea. - About? - About Maybe if you just put on a jacket and a hat. Do you have a poncho? - Are you ashamed of me? - No. No, I'm proud of you. In fact, I'm so proud that yesterday I almost signed up to be a Christian missionary in the Sudan. But you don't want your family and friends to see me. Good, you understand. You know, Alan, my friends are judgmental too. - About what? - About you. None of them get why I'm with you. Well at the risk of shining a light on something better left unexamined why are you with me? Because you're cute and smart and really, really grateful. All true. And if my friends can't understand that, well, then tough tomatoes. - Kandi, you're a remarkable girl. - Thank you. Unfortunately, so am I. Oh, come on, it'll be fun. You wanna have a quickie in the car? Well, all right. But this time let's pull over first. Boring. So where's Alan? He's supposed to be pitching in at this party. I don't know, but I'm guessing that wherever he is, he's pitching. So I suppose Charlie hasn't told you. I have a new man in my life. Oh, good for you, dear. Does the man know yet? Hey, get your own, Red. Nice outfit. - Thanks. Rose picked it out for me. - How about that? You know, sometimes when we're having sex she calls out your name. No kidding? What about the other times? She makes me call it out. Boy, that really wasn't a quickie, was it? The first one was. Anyway, so just to reiterate, today is Jake's day. - It's not about us. - I know. So you can just relax. And don't feel obligated to, you know, socialize or talk to anybody. Don't worry, Alan. I'm not gonna embarrass you. Right, I know you won't. So to summarize what I reiterated, we're just gonna play it cool, low-key. Nothing to be gained by drawing attention to ourselves. I got it. Just don't ring the doorbell. Sorry we're late but I was having sex with this gorgeous 22-year-old woman. Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Come in and say that again. Jake? You in here? It's time to do the birthday cake. Go away. - Did you find him? - Yeah, he's in the bathroom. - Is he okay? - I don't know. - Jake, are you okay? - I'm fine. Go away. He's probably humiliated because his father is dating a Camp Fire Girl. - Give it a rest, Judith. - What's going on? - Jake won't come out of the bathroom. - Come on out, honey. - I can't. - Why not? I just can't. I was wondering where everyone snuck off to. Whatever you're saying about me, you can say right to my face. This isn't about you, Mom. - Wish I could believe that. - What's the holdup? - He won't come out of the bathroom. - He sick? - Who won't come out? - Your grandson. Why? Is he mad at me? - Jake, what have you had to eat today? - Just a little coffee and some vitamins. - Coffee? You let him have coffee? - No. You let him have coffee? - He had a sip. - Well, wait a second. - Why did you take vitamins? - I was tired. Okay, but where did you find vitamins to take? In your medicine cabinet. I don't have any vitamins in my medicine cabinet. Yeah, you do. The little blue ones with a V on them. - What's going on? I don't understand. - The kid's gonna need another party hat. SDl Media Group   





                    			So any thoughts on what you'd like for dinner this weekend? You decide, honey. I love everything you cook. All of a sudden I'm a woman because I cook and try to make a nice home for you? Okay, I heard it too. Shut up. Ramming speed! - Jake. - Leave him alone. With his grades, he might as well get used to pushing shopping carts around. My son is gonna end up working in a supermarket? No, I'm saying he's probably gonna end up homeless. Well, as I live and breathe, Charlie Harper. Oh, great. Archie. So how's the best jingle writer in the business? Looks like he's put on a few pounds. This is my brother Alan. Alan, Archie Baldwin, the king of the jingle writers. Well, I don't know about that. More like the ayatollah of the jingle writers. The grand Pooh-Bah, if you will. Really? What's that make you, Charlie? T o be honest, a little nauseous. We should get together sometime. Maybe collaborate. - I'd like that. - Well, sure, there's no downside for you. What the hell, remind me about it at the awards dinner. Oh, I'm not going to that. Why not? You're nominated. Wait, what are you nominated for? It's a silly advertising award. Doesn't mean anything. Yeah, he's right. It's not about the trophies, it's about the work. PS, my work has won seven trophies. Hey, one more, I'll have a menorah. Well, good luck, Archie. But I think I'll pass. Oh, well, good for you. Stay home and sulk. Nice meeting you. Okay, where do they keep the extra-large condoms? Boy, he's a piece of work. He's a piece of something. How come you never mentioned that whole award thing? I've been nominated plenty of times. - How many times have you won? - What difference does it make? So never. Yes, Alan, never. But that guy Archie has won like seven times. Yes, he has. That's gotta sting. Hey, Alan, you ever been beaten to death with a can of corn? Toe-Zene shouldn't be used by pregnant women people with heart conditions or taking SSI inhibitors. I don't know. This could be my year. - I really think it's your best work. - Thanks. I know I said the same thing about Mr. Herpes Lip Balm. Yeah. Just Like a Woman Natural Douche. And that hemorrhoid cream. What was it called? Fire in the Hole. Yeah, that was good. But Toe-Zene is the one that's finally gonna bring home the gold. - Thanks for your support, Rose. - You're welcome. Now, can you do something for me? No. Oh, come on, Charlie. I want you to talk to my boyfriend. Why would I wanna talk to your boyfriend? Because he's smothering me. And not in the good "can you move your thigh off my face" kind of way. I need my space, Charlie. I wake up in the morning and there he is staring at me. I have a bowl of soup and there he is blowing on it for me. Even when we have sex I can feel his eyes burning a hole in the back of my head. Oh, that's gonna keep me up at night. You need to explain to him that if you love someone, you have to let them go. If they come back, they're yours. If they don't, then you stalk them. I really don't wanna get involved in your love life. Well, if someone doesn't talk to him, we're gonna have to break up. Do what you have to do. Oh, I get it. You want me to be single again. Get him over here. Thank you. Was that so hard? I had no idea these awards were so prestigious. They're meaningless crap. Come on. Look at this list of past winners for best jingle. Barry Manilow, Randy Newman, Kenny Loggins Archie Baldwin, Archie Baldwin Archie Baldwin, Archie What's your point? My point is it's an honor just to be nominated. No, no, it's an honor to win. Being nominated is just a soul-sucking waste of time. Why are you so sure you're gonna lose? It doesn't matter who wrote the best jingle it's about who has the sexiest product. That's why the awards always go to car and beer ads. Over-the-counter medications just aren't hip enough. - That hardly seems fair. - Tell me about it. Encourage people to get drunk and drive fast, great, here's an award. Relieve the heartbreak of vaginal itching? They don't even wanna shake your hand. Well, win or lose, you should still go to the ceremony. No, no, no. No. An awards ceremony is like a Thai massage. If you don't know that there's gonna be a happy ending, no point in lying down. You have a family who's proud of your accomplishments and might like the chance to share them. What family is that? Your family: Me, Jake, Mom. Whoa, do not tell Mom about this nomination. - It's a good thing. - It doesn't matter. If it's a good thing she'll find a way to make it bad. - Okay, now you're just being ridiculous. - Oh, really? Let's try a little experiment. I'll pretend I'm Mom, you tell me something good. All right. Hey, Mom, I have discovered a cure for cancer. Very nice. Shame you couldn't do it in time to save Uncle Walter's left testicle. Come on, give me another one. - No, I get the idea. - No, no. no. Hit me. Okay. Gee, Mom, it really is a beautiful day, huh? Try telling that to Uncle Walter's one good nut. Okay. I adore my son. Somebody has to. - How about friendship? - How about Judas? - Family. - Manson. - Puppies. - Rabies. - Love. - Communicable disease. - You win. - Quitter. - Leave me alone. - You're already alone. Your wife threw you out, remember? Damn it, Gordon, get up there and talk to Charlie. But I don't wanna talk to Charlie. Do you like having sex with me, Gordon? Hey, Charlie. Hey, Gordon. - What's going on? - Oh, not much. I was just passing by, thought I'd see how you were doing. I'm doing fine. Good. Good. Nice shirt. Right back at you. So Rose says I have to talk to you or I can't have sex with her anymore. I see. You sure you're making the right choice? Call me crazy. Well, crazy's the price of admission for that ride. Okay, come here, sit down. - You want a beer? - Oh, no, thank you. I'm a really mean drunk. I sensed that. Anyway, the thing you need to understand about Rose about any woman really, is that they want what they can't have. But Rose can have me. Trust me on this, Gordon. You play it cool, keep your distance, be aloof you'll have to call the cops to get rid of her. - You really think so? - No, I know so. But they won't come right away. She'll still have time to hot-glue her high school graduation picture to your freshly shaved ass. Hey, Mom, here's some good news. It seems with medical breakthroughs the average life span will soon be 100 years. Wonderful. More time to be ignored by your children. Amazing. Morning, Mom. You're looking very pretty today. That's nice, because inside I'm dead. When you're right, you're right. Charlie, I need a favor. Yeah, well, I need a healthy liver, and there's a long waiting list for both. I've got a client coming into town next Saturday. - And he's bringing his lovely daughter. - And by lovely she means dog-like. All right, she may not be a beauty queen, but she does have a terrific figure. I'm guessing six nipples. Anyhow, I was hoping you could show her a good time. No big deal. You don't have to take her to dinner. Go to the beach and throw a stick till she gets tired. Gee, Mom, as much as I'd love to service the unfortunate little schnauzer -  I'm busy next Saturday. - What are you doing? I I've I've got a I've got a thing. Don't lie. You've got nothing, you just don't want to help me. No, no, no. No, I swear, I have plans. I'm going to this awards ceremony. You never go to these things. Yeah, well, this year's different. Your client's daughter will just have to hump somebody else's leg. I told you I could get him to go. This is really boring. Just keep it to yourself, Jake. I just don't understand why I had to come. You're here to support your Uncle Charlie. The same way he supported you at your Christmas pageant. The one where you stood in back picking lint off your antlers while the rest of the class recited "The Night Before Kwanzaa. " Oh, yeah. - Uncle Charlie? - What? Now you have to come to my Easter pageant. - This event isn't televised, is it? - No. Well, I guess they only show the important awards. Congratulations, you've just been elected tonight's designated driver. Come on, just ignore her. Ignore her? It'd be easier to ignore blood in my urine. Well, well, well, look who decided to be a good sport. Speaking of blood in my urine. Hey, Archie. Hey, I wanna tell you people this man has been a real inspiration to me. - Oh, come on. - No, no, I mean it. When I'm struggling to write a jingle and I feel like I'm not measuring up I ask myself, "How would Charlie Harper write this? " And the answer always makes me feel better about my own work. Charlie, aren't you going to introduce me? Mom, Archie. Archie, Mom. You're Charlie's mother? Oh, a teenage pregnancy, no doubt. How brave of you to keep him. Well, aren't you adorable. Mom. Archie is nominated in the same category as Charlie. Oh, well, I'll be rooting for you, Archie. - Okay, then, thanks for stopping by. - Good luck. - You deserve it this year. - Thanks. I mean, how many times can they snub you? - I don't really keep track. - Seven. Seven years in a row. If you say so. Hey, stick around after the ceremony. If I win, I'll let you hold my trophy. Not to mention the little statue they give me. Isn't the little statue the trophy? Just eat your chicken. Before we present the Jingle of the Y ear Award we have a special treat. Please tell me they're gonna pass out guns. Our very own seven-time award winner here to perform his own nominated tune composed especially for the United Nations Save-an-Orphan program Oh, God, not orphans. Archie Baldwin. Oh, goodie. This is for all the orphans out there. There's no tree at Christmastime No pumpkin Hallow's Eve No candles on the birthday cake No reason to believe He works all day in a cold, dark mine His little lungs filled with soot Her mommy's Kim Jong's concubine Her dad was killed By the Tonton Macoutes Save the orphans Save the orphans Don't do it for me Don't do it for you Do it for little Kim Sung And Abu Yeah, save the orphans Come on, everybody. Save the orphans They' re tax-deductible. Save the orphans Get them while they' re still cute. Save the orphans Get them young, teach them your tongue. Save the orphans Woody Allen can't marry them all. Save the orphans Some of them don't even have parents. Save the orphans Get two, get one free. Save the orphans Use them as bait for scholarships. Save the orphans Save the orphans Save the orphans Enough. Come on. It's catchy. So is diphtheria. How come you don't get a runner-up trophy? Because I don't. At school everybody gets a trophy just for participating. Well, Jake, that's the difference between school and life. In life all you get for participating is pain, loneliness and death. Better luck next year, Charlie. Good night, boys. Oh, yeah, I forgot. There's also crushing humiliation. Well, in sixth grade, you get a trophy. Hey, can I get you anything? A length of rope and a rickety stool? Charlie, it's understandable that you might be a little blue right now but that will pass. Get out of here, Alan. You know, I often find that when things look darkest it really helps to share your I swear, I will drop-kick you over that railing. Alrighty. Pleasant dreams. You don't dream in a blackout, you moron. - Hey, Charlie. - Oh, God. - How did it go tonight? - Let me put it this way: What the advertising community did to me earlier this evening Archie Baldwin is now doing to my mother. He's not acknowledging her wonderful talent? - Just leave it alone, Rose. - Sorry. Have you seen Gordon? Not since I talked to him. And by the way, thanks for that opportunity. I've always wanted to bond with a pasty kid who dresses like me. Well, I don't know what you said to him, but he's been acting very strange lately. Lately? I keep calling, but he doesn't pick up the phone. And when I leave a message, he doesn't call back. I thought you wanted him to stop being so clingy. I thought I did too. Now I miss his cute little face peeking at me while I'm washing my hair, shaving my legs, soaping up my breasts which you no doubt remember are extremely firm and perky. So he spies on you in the shower? No, that would be weird. Why is love so complicated? I don't know, Rose. Stuff happens. Oh, Charlie, you always know the right thing to say. This is a fine kettle of fish. Oh, why can't I just black out in peace? "Be aloof," you said, "play hard to get. " You just wanted me out of your way so you could make your move. You caught me, Gordon. Now, do the right thing and kill me. Oh, Charlie, is this true? Is this part of some devious plan to win me back? You heard her, Gordon. Kill me. Rose, you wanted him out of your hair. I got him out of your hair. - You wanted to get rid of me? - No, I just need some space. You want space? I'll give you all the space you want. - Fine. - In fact, I'll leave right now. Well, great. I'll just stay here with Charlie. Nobody leaves. Nobody stays. Rose, get off me. Okay, now, everybody listen carefully because I'm pretty sure I'm only gonna be able to say this once. Rose, think about it. Where are you gonna find a guy who loves you as much as Gordon? And, Gordon, where are you gonna find a girl, period. The man makes sense, Rose. You're damn right I make sense. If you kids don't patch things up, you know what's gonna happen? You're gonna wind up old, miserable and alone. He's right, Gordon. Look what happened to him. I love you, Rose. I love you too. Oh, good, a happy ending. Now, get the hell off my deck. - Come on, Lambchop, let's go home. - Hold on. Climbing over the rail is ridiculous and juvenile. From now on, I wanna take the stairs. Do you like having sex with me, Gordon? Call me crazy. And the real winner tonight is Charlie Harper. A man with a heart so big that he'd step outside of his own misery to help two people in need. Alan, I'm warning you. I know you don't wanna hear this. Let me tell you. The Archie Baldwins of this world are soon forgotten. It's people like you, people who are selfless and generous who will live on forever. Last chance. Oh, please, that grumpy-gus routine does not Good night. SDl Media Group   





                    			Alan, I forgot my toothbrush. Can I use yours? Oh, dear Lord, no. Do you have any idea how many bacteria can be transferred on a toothbrush? I don't know. How many? Okay, I don't know the actual amount. Then why did you bring it up? Poor judgment. The point is, sharing these things is a bad idea. Are you saying you don't want your toothbrush in my mouth? I know, I know. I get the hypocrisy. Just humor me. Okay, I have hard, medium or soft bristles. I have straight or curved handles. And for your flossing needs I have waxed, mint-waxed, un-waxed. If you're feeling especially adventurous, may I suggest the cinnamon? Maybe I'll just wait till I get home. No, no. One day you skip brushing and before you know it your teeth rot away and you're begging strangers to start your apple. Fine. I'll take the pink one. I always wondered, what's the rubber thing at the end for? It's to massage your gums. Oh, I thought it might be an eraser. But who writes when they're brushing their teeth? I don't know. What's the matter? Oh, nothing. Nothing. Well, I kind of have to pee. - Go ahead. - Oh, no, I'll wait till you're finished. Are you shy about peeing in front of me? Because, Alan Again, I get the hypocrisy. I think it's important to keep a little mystery in a relationship. It's just peeing, Alan. Not necessarily. Sometimes when a man urinates other muscles see that as a green light to relax. So you've never peed in front of a girl? Well, my ex-wife, but after six, seven years of marriage who gives a damn anymore? - Okay, I'll brush out here. - Thank you. - What? - One of my teeth hurts when I brush it. When was the last time you saw a dentist? Alan, I see people all the time. They don't always tell you what they do. Hey, are you done? Because I gotta rinse. No, I can't go when I know you're listening. Would it help if I sang the pee-pee song? - The what? - My mom used to sing it to me. Tinkle, tinkle, little star In the potty not the car Up above the bowl so high Like the raindrops in the sky Hey, hey, it's working. Green light. Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop. - Should I try it again? - Not yet. Okay, now. Okay, stop, stop, stop. Morning. - Morning. - Morning, Charlie. Need any help? Do you know how to get a 1981 Plymouth Duster moving? Y eah, yank out the eight track and push it off a cliff. You're useless. Sorry. - You got a little grease on your face. - Where? Cheek. Did I get it? No, other side. - Now? - Little on your forehead. - Yeah? - Perfect. Now sing "Swanee River. " Alan, should I try it again? No. I'm gonna call AAA. Good. No sense drinking over this. You must be so proud. Hey, she may not be sophisticated, but she's street-smart. Sesame Street-smart. Just leave it alone. Let me ask you something. Have you stopped to consider the long-term cost of a relationship with a girl that young? Charlie, it's a free tow. Oh, sure. That's how it always starts, with a free tow. But who's gonna pay to fix the car after it's towed? "Um" is right, my dim-witted friend. And that's just the beginning. Girls like Kandi need all kinds of stuff the only way they can pay for it is through horny morons like you. Her car breaks down and I should just dump her? - This is a short-term relationship? - I don't know. Trust me, it's a short-term relationship. Kandi's not the brightest bulb in the chandelier but even she's gonna wake up wonder what she's doing shacked up with a penniless putz who's twice her age. Kandi's not like that. Just wait. Your first minor stroke and she'll be boinking the cardiologist before you can scrawl "What happened? " on your note pad. Okay, for the sake of argument let's say you're right, what's your point? My point is, you don't dry-clean a rented tuxedo. You don't redecorate a hotel room. You don't order cable for a port-a-potty unless you're really, really drunk. And you don't take on the bills of a girl that's got the attention span of a monkey chewing on a fly swatter. Okay, I appreciate your how shall I describe it, compassionate advice but all I'm doing here is arranging a free tow for a friend. Alan, I don't think the engine's flooded anymore. - Fire extinguisher? - Under the sink. Hey, if you don't hurry up, you'll be late. I don't mind. Okay, well, that takes the pressure off. How come my dad's not bringing me? - He's helping Kandi get her car fixed. - Oh, jeez. And him already broker than a headless hooker. Hey, how come my mom hates Kandi? What gave you the idea she hates her? Because she says so. A lot. All right. Why do you think? I don't know. She's pretty, she's fun and Dad seems real happy with her. Well, little man, you just answered your own question. I did? What'd I say? It's like this. You ever see a kid at school who doesn't like his lunch but he won't let you have it? Oh, yeah, Russell Beasley. He'll spit on his apple cobbler before he'll let anybody else eat it. This is pretty much the same deal, except your mom is Russell Beasley and your dad is the spit-covered cobbler. I don't understand. Though your mom doesn't want your dad she doesn't want Kandi to eat him either. You know, I like cobbler with ice cream. Way to follow a train of thought. Thanks. Well, I guess we should go to school now. Couldn't hurt. I'll see if I can find my books. Sweet kid. Yeah. Shame he'll never be anything more than a burden to society. Do you know a good lawyer, Alan? No, but my ex-wife does. - Why? - Because I wanna sue the guy who sold me that lemming. - You mean lemon. - I do? Okay. Did you get any kind of a written guarantee when you bought it? No, it was more of an oral agreement. All right, Mr. Harper, I looked at your daughter's vehicle. She's not my daughter. Good for you. Anyway, the prognosis looks rather bleak. - I understand. - I mean, the vehicle was on fire. I know. What, is she like 21? - Twenty-two. - And a half. Good for you. - Yeah, what about the car? - Oh, the car? The cars gotta be 25, 26 years old. - I mean, can it be fixed? - Anything can be fixed. Hell, they put a pig's heart in my Uncle Vinnie. - How much? - All of it. My Aunt Phyllis likes to call him the other white meat now. No, I mean how much to fix the car? For you, three grand. What? Once again, the car was on fire. I had to wait an hour before I could even touch it. But I only paid 800 for it. Eight hundred dollars? I hate to be the bearer of sad tidings, but some business person has taken advantage of your good nature. Boy, that happens a lot. Well, 3000 is out of the question. It'd make more sense just to get her a new car. Oh, Alan, thank you. That's the sweetest thing anybody's ever done for me. Good for you. - Hi. - Hey. Why isn't your car in the garage? I loaned it to Kandi. And how much are you paying to fix hers? For your information, nothing. Nothing? Not a cent. I'm leasing her a Saturn. Tell me again about the free tow, Alan. Come on, she needs a car and the lease terms are surprisingly reasonable. They're practically giving them away. Excuse me. Where are you going? I'm gonna solve all your problems. Wanna see it coming or should I surprise you? You're not funny. Hello? Hang on a second. It's your dentist, he wants to talk to you about Kandi's teeth. Thank you. Hi, Dr. Weinberger. Thanks for seeing her on such short notice. Can I have some privacy, please? Sure, get your own place. No, she's not covered under my dental plan. Twenty-two and a half. Yeah, yeah, good for me. Did you get a chance to look at her tooth? Oh, a root canal. Well, how much is that? What do you mean there's more? Who told you to look at her wisdom teeth? That girl's got wisdom teeth? Okay, what's the worst thing that could happen if you don't take them out? How infected? All right, if it has to be done, it has to be done. Yeah, send me the bill. Okay, bye-bye. Here. Aim for the cheap seats. Alan, what are you doing? You know, a little bit of a cash-flow crunch and I thought I'd use this to pay some bills. I see. Mind helping me out? Sure. Promise me you'll spend it on food, not whiskey. My pain brings you a lot of pleasure, huh? I'm a simple man. It's your ex-wife. Oh, perfect. Get the bat. This is the bat. Hello? Oh, good. I was hoping it'd be you. Of course I remember the Alamo. Oh, you mean alimony. I was thinking Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie. Oh, come on, Judith, why can't we share a few chuckles? Oh, no, no, I agree. There's nothing chuckle-worthy about a subpoena. Well, you know, I will tell you what. I will bring you the check when I pick up Jake. I promise. Okay. Okay. Bye-bye. You gotta pick up Jake. - Why? - Because I don't have her money. It's in Kandi's mouth and Kandi's car. What about The Treasure of the Sierra Madre over there? This? This is nothing. One car payment and maybe a bikini wax. - Bikini wax? - A girl's gotta keep those up. It's a landscaping issue. You just gotta buy me some time with Judith. What are you gonna do with more time? You can't sell your blood, your ex-wife already took that. And if you sell your sperm, what's the point in dating Kandi? Well, for your information, I do have other options. - Like what? - I've been looking at part-time work. And I have some very promising auctions on eBay. Oh, really? What are you auctioning? Well, a few rare books, a couple of lithos, a set of golf clubs. Since when do you play golf? Well, technically, they're your clubs. You're stealing from me? Oh, come on, you only bought them so you could go to Palm Springs and pick up lesbians. This is ridiculous. Why don't you just ask me to lend you some money? - Would you lend me money? - Absolutely. If I hadn't taken a bath on the Super Bowl. Well, I need to do this by myself anyway. You know, I still have my pride. Wow, you really think that, huh? Well, it doesn't matter as long as I have Kandi. She looks up to me, she thinks I'm special. She thinks I'm smart. She thinks gazpacho is Pinocchio's father. What can I say, Charlie? I'm crazy about her. All right, I certainly don't wanna stand in the way of your happiness. Thank you. - One question though. - Yeah? What are you gonna tell Jake when he notices his change jug is gone? Oh, it'll be okay. I left him a post-dated check. It'll be good by the time he goes to college. Yeah, like that kid's going to college. - Perfect, just perfect. - Judith, I know what you're thinking I'll tell you what, your brother's a little coward who don't have guts to face his responsibilities There's more to this than meets the eye. I suppose you're gonna explain it to me. I'm gonna try if you'll calm down for a minute and listen. - All right, I'm listening. - Are you calm? I'm listening. Okay. You know why Alan's not here? Because he's ashamed. - Well, he should be. - Judith, that's not listening. He's ashamed because no matter how hard he works he just can't seem to get ahead. You know, his business is falling apart. Really? He hasn't said anything. Because he's too proud. Poor guy lost all his chiropractic walk-ins to an unlicensed massage parlor that opened up right between him and the Jamba Juice. - You're kidding. - I'm deadly serious. Who's gonna pay to have their spine adjusted when for half the price they can get their dingus dusted? Well, I wouldn't know about that. As it turns out, I'm a bit of an expert. And I'm telling you, he's going under. Oh, my God. - You know he took a part-time job? - No. But you didn't hear it from me. And please, please don't say anything to Jake. The last thing Alan wants is to look like a failure in the eyes of that little boy in there. Of course not. - I won't say a word. - Thank you. Hey, where's Dad? Just go with Uncle Charlie. Okay. Why is Mom crying? Because I'm good. I'm very, very good. I'm really getting tired of pizza. Well, I'm off to work. Get used to it. Enjoy your pizza. Alan, Alan, what are you doing? I swear to God, I'll get your alimony as soon as possible. - No, please, don't worry about it. - Really? Charlie told me what's going on. - I don't need the money right now. - Really? I haven't mentioned it. When my grandmother passed away she left me a pretty substantial inheritance. Really? In fact, I want you to have this. - Really? - Pay me when you can. The important thing is you get back on your feet. I'm so happy. Hi, Huggy Bear. Boy, I love the new car you got me. Hi, Mrs. Harper, doesn't he look cute in a mustache? I'm so sad. How's that pride doing? Nice, they let you take a few home. It's in lieu of health insurance. Did you know they actually have a little machine that shoots the cheese into the crust? - Is that so? - Yep. It's a little high-pressure gun. You can't kill yourself with it, though. I tried. I gotta tell you something, Alan, this is from the bottom of my heart. I think that you are the stupidest man on the face of the Earth but I admire your perseverance. You're gonna have to talk into the other ear. This one's full of cheese. Is that my Huggy Bear? Yeah, it's him. Hey, guess what. You know my roommates Ellie and Emmett? Yeah. Turns out they're not really brother and sister so they started sleeping together. Oh, that's lovely. Anyway, now they're gonna get their own place and I don't know how I'm gonna pay the rent by myself. Oh, God, Kandi, I can't. I can't. I'm all tapped out. All I have left to put on eBay is a kidney or a lung. If I were you, I'd sell the kidney because lungs don't grow back. I'm sorry, honey you're just gonna have to handle your living situation on your own. Okay. Hey, guess what else. You've got a loved one who needs either an operation or bail? No, silly. I'm finished with the dentist and my mouth is all better. See? Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't you move in with me? Okay. I'm so screwed. SDl Media Group   





                    			You're up early. Well, it's a beautiful day, shame to waste it sleeping. - Must've got to bed early then. - I guess. Well, you know what they say. Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and can't get laid, huh? Maybe I'm not trying. Y eah. And look for me next month on the cover of Maxim. I'll have nothing on but the vacuum. - Hey, you're up early. - Y es, Alan, I'm up early. I went to bed early and I slept alone. Anything else you wanna know? Was I this cranky when I wasn't having sex? No, you were more of a sullen whiner. - Okay, Huggy Bear, I gotta go. - Oh, all right, Kandi, have a good day. Yo, Daisy Mae. Just out of curiosity, when you leave here, where is it you go? T o the gym. I have to take care of my body because it's my instrument. Mine too. Three beers and a bratwurst and my ass turns into a French horn. Really? Whenever I have beer and bratwurst I just fart a lot. Okay. Okay, Kandi, well, I'll see you tonight. Bye, everybody. Congratulations, Alan. It looks like you've officially boinked her brains out. Okay, so she's not overly sophisticated. Sophisticated? She's two marbles rolling around in a tin can. Hey, hey, she's got a great heart, she's warm and loving. - And she genuinely cares for me. - I stand corrected. One marble. Look, buddy, I'm happy you finally found an instrument to play that isn't in your own pants. But she's been spending a lot of time here. If you're not careful, she's gonna wanna move in. Would that be so bad? Hey, I don't have a lot of rules around here but nine of the top ten are just different ways of saying: "Women are not allowed to live here. " They come and they go. Often they do one of those multiple times, but in the end they always go. But why is that so important? Alan, there's a natural balance in this house, which must not be upset. It's like the Amazon rain forest. You bring in one too many spider monkeys you're up to your ass in tree frogs. Oh tree frogs. That clears up everything. Don't patronize me, you hump-happy simpleton. - You know what I'm saying. - I do. If Kandi were to move in here, it would be an environmental disaster -  of epic proportions. - Exactly. She's been living here the past three weeks. - What? - Who's the simpleton now? Kandi got evicted from her apartment three weeks ago and she moved in here. Oh, please, if a woman was living in my own house for that long I think I'd notice. Oh, really? Really? Well, let's try a little experiment. What color is the couch in the living room? - The couch? - No peeking. What color is it? Well, it's kind of a Beige-ish Tan. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Go look. - Fine. What the hell is that? Your couch. Jake spilled grape juice on it last summer. I had it reupholstered. - Last summer? - Yeah, it was gone almost a month. Berta and I bet on how long it would take you to notice. I had 50 bucks on never. All right, all right this is unacceptable. This is my house and if furniture's gonna get reupholstered or moved or changed in any way whatsoever, I demand to be consulted. - Okay, from now on. I promise. - Thank you. I bought the damn thing. Think I'd have a vote, maybe show me a swatch. Hey, wait a minute, did somebody say Kandi's living here? Boy, am I thirsty. That's because you sweat so much during sex. I may not have the biggest boat in the marina. But nobody rows harder than me. You have a boat? - No, sweetie, what I meant was - Hey, hey, hey. Some of us don't wanna hear about your little dinghy. - Oh, hi, Charlie. - What're you doing here? I was asking myself the same thing so I did a little research and it turns out it's my house. Yeah, but I thought you were going out. - I did go out. And then I came back. - Alone? No, Alan, I brought home an invisible cocktail waitress. She's doing me even as we speak. You're right. There's no way you could've been that cranky. You want some company, Charlie? Alan can't have sex again for at least 30 minutes. That's a rough estimate. Thanks, but I'd really rather be alone. Okey-doke. Come on, I think he wants to masturbate. Not for at least 30 minutes. Okay, I haven't sampled anything from the other side of the buffet since I traveled with the Grateful Dead. But golly Moses, she's a muffin. Interesting turn of events, huh? Your brother hitting one of your hand-me-downs. And you couldn't get laid if you painted your penis to look like money. Don't think I haven't tried. I'm reminded of the tale of the tortoise and the hare. Isn't there something you could be doing? Well, I could go rub some oil on her, but I don't trust myself. Berta, please don't take this the wrong way but it's been a long time for me and you're starting to turn me on. I'm out of here. - Hi, Berta. - Hey, baby. - Hi, Charlie. - Hi. - Boy, this is weird, huh? - In so many ways. But which one caught your attention? Well, I've never slept with brothers before. I mean at different times. And one can't help but make comparisons. No kidding. So how big a difference are we talking about? It's huge. - Really? - Oh, yeah. With you, sex is kind of like going on Space Mountain. It's a good ride, but there's never any real danger. With Alan, it's like being in the back seat of a car driven by a really smart kangaroo. He may go up on the curb a couple times, but he'll get you there. Okay. Thanks for clearing that up. I'll get it. There's a two hour wait for Space Mountain. - Hi, Mrs. Harper. - Oh, dear lord. Hey, Kandi, I got Evil Dead 3 for Xbox. Sweet. Kandi, maybe you'd like to go put some clothes on. - Why? - Yeah, she ain't hurting anybody. I just don't think that outfit is appropriate for Jake. Oh, I agree. He would look ridiculous in this. Can you get Alan for me? - He's not back from work yet. - He's not? - Then what are you doing here? - I live here now. Didn't Alan tell you? No, he did not. - Charlie, I wanna talk to you. - Good to know. Charlie, get over here. It was nice seeing you, Mrs. Harper. What in God's name does she see in him? Well, I don't have all the details, Mrs. Harper. But apparently when he's not being emasculated and demoralized on a daily basis, he's quite the lover. - What's that supposed to mean? - You know what they say. Your average man's like a good field mule. If you don't beat him, he'll keep plowing all day long. - Nobody says that. - You're hard to fool. Look, I don't mean to be rude, but I'm tired of talking to you. Had an interesting chat with your ex-wife. Oh, can't we just have a nice dinner? - I like her. - Why? Why? Well, unlike most ex-wives I've known she's never tried to run me over with her car. Okay, new dinner conversation. Jake, how was school? I don't think this conversation'll make you any happier, Dad. - What now? - We had a surprise test today. - And? - I was really surprised. So, in other words, you weren't prepared. You can't prepare for a surprise, Dad. New conversation? Jake, what are we gonna do? You've really fallen behind this year. I know. I think it's a delayed reaction to your divorce. - Oh? - Yeah. It took a while, but my teachers have finally stopped feeling sorry for me. You know, I'm a child of divorce too, Jake. Really? How old were you when your parents split up? - Twenty-two. - But you're 22 now. Twenty-two and a half. Boy, what I'd give to be 22 again. New subject? No, no, no more conversation. Jake, if you're finished, go do your homework. I'm gonna need help. - You don't need help, you need to focus. - I'll help you. Do you know anything about geometry? Well, I know it's what you say when you turn into a tree. Get it? Gee, I'm a tree. Good one. Thanks. Boy, I hope when they get to Oz the wizard has two brains to give out. And speaking of out, when's Kandi leaving? - You don't have to worry. - Because? I have a plan. Alan, if history has taught us anything it's that both those statements cannot be true. It's very simple. You give a man a fish, he eats for a day. You teach him to fish, he eats forever. Okay, okay, in that example is Kandi the man or the fish? I found her a job. She'll be able to afford her own place and she won't depend on me anymore. Where is she working? - She's gonna be my receptionist. - That's your plan? Why it's brilliant. What, what? She's attractive, she's friendly and she's more than capable of answering the phones. You hear the expression "don't crap where you eat"? Well, you, my friend, are dropping plunkies all over the dessert cart. - Okay, you have a better solution? - No, no, no. No, it's your girlfriend, your office, your life. Screw it up however you think best. I'll get it. I'm expecting a call. Hello? Kandi, that's the TV remote. Hello? Hello? Have you thought of teaching a fish to answer your phones? Hello? - Staying in tonight? - Y ep. - Giving up on the ladies, huh? - Y ep. - Not even gonna try? - Nope. You know, I got a niece in the joint. She doesn't look like much, but she does get conjugal visits. I don't think so. Hold on, I might have a copy of her mug shot. Here. She looks a little wall-eyed but that's because they had to use a Taser to get her out of the shed. - The shed? - She was running a meth lab. But you gotta admit, she is nice and slender. - Thanks, but pass. - Think about it. Visiting days are Wednesdays and Fridays. But if you decide to go, be a sport, take her a pie. - Right. - Make it something chewy. The prison dentist set her up with some real nice teeth. Okay. Now this isn't my lamp. What happened to my lamp? Unless this is my lamp. Yeah, this is my lamp. I bought this lamp to go with my couch. My tan couch. Worst day of my life. Yeah, well, it was no picnic for me either. - I don't know who you are anymore. - You wanna know who I am? I'm the idiot paying you $10 an hour to miss phone calls. Nap in the bathroom. Use my x-ray machine on Mexican food. Well, I wanted to know what's inside a chimichanga. If you didn't know, why'd you order it? Because it's fun to say chimichanga. Chimichanga. See? So, how was work? Horrible. All he did was boss me around: "Do this, do that, wake up. " Maybe that's because I'm your boss. A stupid, stinky boss. Anybody wanna know about my problems? It was supposed to be Sloppy Joes for lunch. But instead they had fish sticks. Well, it ruined my day. No, no, no, I'll get it. That's what I do. That's all I'm good for. Hello? Oh, fudge. Picture an entire day of this. With six lines. Hello? Oh, hi, Mrs. Harper. Oh, great. Kandi, Kandi, give me the phone, give me Back off buck-o. Was your ex-husband always such a control freak? She says you were. You know what he did today? Kandi, you don't have to get into that with her. She says she wants to know. Well, first of all at the office he tried to make me call him Dr. Harper all day. And when I forgot he yelled at me. What? Chiropractors aren't really doctors. You liar. I so get why you dumped him. - Hey, Alan? - What? Is this a new lamp? I would like that so much, Mrs. Harper. Okay, I will call you Judith. Great, I'll see you there. See her where? We're going out for a drink and a little girl talk. Girl talk with my ex-wife? Her name is Judith, Mr. "I'm not a doctor" Harper. Don't wait up. You just crapped where you used to eat. - Hey. - Hey. - What are you doing up so late? - What time is it? It's 3 a. m. Oh, well then, I got my eight hours. What are you doing, waiting up for Kandi? Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't sleep. So I thought I'd read a little. A furniture catalog? I like furniture. - Just looking at the pictures, huh? - What are you getting at, Charlie? I think you buy things. I think you bought this lamp. - That lamp was here when I moved in. - Oh, really? Charlie, I'm afraid that this dry streak is starting to affect your mind. Maybe you're right. Sure, this is my lamp. I've had it for years. - The table it's on is new. - I knew it. We don't wanna wake up Mr. Alan Hitler. No, no, Osama bin Alan. - Busted. - What the hell is going on here? The hell what is going on here is that I need an advance on my "amilony. " - Why? - T o pay Estefan, our limo driver. You took a limo? We couldn't find our cars and we spent all our money on JELL-O shots, and chimichangas. All right, all right. Kandi, you need to go to bed. We have to get up early for work. No, we don't. Because I quit. Why don't we talk about this in the morning? All right, Judith, here is you're "amilony. " - Thank you. - Go home. And Kandi, go to bed. I do not wish to live with you any furthermore. - What? - I have been invited to stay with my good friend Judith. Come on, I'll help you pack your things. Did you ever notice how much he sweats during sex? Well, good for you. Good for me? How is this good for me? - You got Kandi out of the house. - I didn't want Kandi out. And I didn't want her moving in with my ex-wife. Oh, right. Okay then, good for me. - Harper? - Here. I'm gonna have to check your pie. Rhubarb. Oh, my girls like rhubarb. Okay, inmate 37059. Down the hall, third door on the left. There's a button by the bed. Push it if she gets violent. Thank you. - It won't open. - Try it again. Boy, you really are having a dry streak, aren't you? Oh, God. I can't even get laid in a women's prison. - Hi, are you Alan? - No, I'm his brother, Charlie. Oh, well, I'm looking for Kandi. She told me she was living here. Actually, she moved. It's a very funny story. - Are you a friend? - I'm her mother. Come on in and I'll see if I can find a forwarding address. Thank you. Chimichanga. - Beautiful place. - Thank you. I see where Kandi gets her good looks. Thanks, unfortunately she gets her brains from her moron father. Oh, right, you're recently divorced. Would you like a drink? I would love one. Great. Why don't you step out on to the deck, and I'll be right there. Good news, it's raining out on my deck. Say what? The dry streak is over. So, what am I supposed to do with this pie?

                    			Hey, what are you doing home in the middle of the afternoon? Look outside. I guess the day got away from me. - So you still depressed? - What do you think? By the looks of things I'd say you're one sad song away from deep-throating a shotgun. Be a pal and put down a tarp first. How did my life get to this point, Charlie? How does how does a man sink this low? Well, in all fairness, you had a running start. Sorry, sorry. Go on. Things were going so well. I had a young, hot girlfriend who fulfilled all my sexual desires. - How many desires are we talking about? - Just the one. You know for sex. But now she's gone. Buddy, she's not really gone. You know where she is. Yeah. And where is that, Alan? Why are you doing this? Say it, Alan. The healing begins when you can say it out loud. My girlfriend is living with my ex-wife. You know, I was wrong. It's not the healing that begins when you say it out loud it's the laughter. Nice talking to you. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Don't you wanna hear how I can help you with all this? I'm not going back to Tijuana for another X-rated performance of The Bride and the Burro. Okay. First of all, that's not what I was gonna suggest. But if you recall, that trip got you through a particularly dark depressing part of your divorce. The first time you smiled in months was when you caught the bouquet. All right, against my better judgment I'm gonna go and ask. How do you propose to help me? Well, first let's make sure that we agree on the problem. - Your ex-wife befriended your girlfriend. - Yes. And your girlfriend has moved in with your ex-wife. Yes. Your ex-wife is turning your girlfriend against you. Do we have to go through this? Just until it stops being funny. Anyway, it would seem to me the simple solution is to find someone to speak to Kandi on your behalf. Someone she trusts. Yes, that would be great. Now, what's your point? Charlie? If you're not coming back at least tell me where you keep the fresh batteries. I'll be right up. And it's rechargeable. My point is, I'm banging Kandi's mom. What? You're welcome. Who is it? You know damn well who it is. I'm entertaining. Not as much as you seem to think. Hang on. No, not you. You let go. Come on in, Alan. - Are you decent? - He's above average. Just come in. Come on. Oh, he's cute. I can see why Kandi likes him. Used to like him. Oh yeah, I'm so sorry about that. Come, sit. Let's talk about it. Are you sure I'm not interrupting? Don't worry about it. Kind of hit the seventh-inning stretch anyway. You can go two more innings? Even if I have to start throwing knuckle balls. Sit down. Okay. So you're Kandi's mom, huh? - Mandi. - Alan. Some grip, huh? Well, Mandi, I can see where Where your daughter gets her good looks from. Thank you. You know, a lot of people think we're sisters. Oh, there's a mental picture that'll get me through the last two innings. - Don't be naughty. - Why, are you gonna spank me? - I just might. - I just might let you. I just might go hang myself. Oh, relax. Oh, Kandi said he was a little shy. First time they had sex, he didn't take his shirt off. Excuse me, that wasn't shyness. The first time I had sex with your daughter, I barely got my pants off. Whoa, whoa, whoa, boundaries. This is Kandi's mom. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to create an awkward moment. But enough about me. How is it that you two are I mean, you know how did you exactly? What the hell is going on here? Good question, and a great story. Mandi showed up here looking for Kandi. That's not a great story. Sure it is. It's already had like half a dozen happy endings. You are definitely going over my knee. Alan, we gotta wrap it up here. But you said you'd help me with Kandi. I didn't say now. - Do you want me to talk to her? - I would really appreciate it. Excuse me, but the pitcher's all warmed up and ready to take the mound. Of course, I'm kind of busy at the moment. Got it. Oh, charge! - Hey, Dad. Mom, Dad's here. - Hey. No, don't, don't bother your mom. Is Kandi around? - Yeah, she lives here now. - I know. Does this mean she and Mom are gay? - No, it does not. - Too bad. - Why? - Be a lot easier to explain. - Could you just tell Kandi I'm here? - Okay. Kandi, my dad's here. - What do you want, Alan? - I wanna talk to Kandi. - I don't think that's a good idea. - Why? She's a sweet, innocent girl. I don't want you to ruin her life too. - Too? How did I ruin your life? - You stole my youth. You took my house. That seems like a fair trade. Face it. This escapade with Kandi is just a pathetic attempt to find a younger version of me. Are you kidding? Judith, I had a younger version of you and let me tell you, it was no great shakes. It's okay, Judith. I'll talk to him. He doesn't want to talk to you. There's only one thing a man is interested in. What? Forget it. I'm here if you need me. Hello, Alan. Listen, Kandi, I'm really sorry about our fight. I know I can be a little bit of a control freak and But I honestly care for you and I hope you'll give me another chance. I see. Excuse me. I can't let you steal my youth. You're not fooling anybody, Judith. Come on, Kandi, tell me what you think. Okay. I think we've reached an implants in our relationship. Impasse. I think we've reached an impasse in our relationship. Goodbye. Excuse me, is this Judith Harper's house? Yeah. She traded it for her youth. - Hi, Daddy. - Hi, sweetheart. Come on in. Judith can't wait to meet you. I can't wait to meet her. I know you two are gonna love each other. I watch one donkey sex show and you make me pay for it the rest of my life. Who is it? Don't screw with me, Charlie. We need to talk. Give me a sec. Charlie, you're just making it tighter. Oh, the hell with it. Come on in, Alan. - Hey there. - Hiya. - You know, I can come back. - It's okay, Alan. Come, sit. All right. So how did it go with Kandi? If it had gone well do you think I'd be sitting here talking to two half-naked people? - Alan? - What? I'm completely naked. What happened, Alan? Well, as I suspected, Judith has turned your daughter against me. Well, I'm not surprised. Kandi's always been very suggestible. You know, until she was 8 she thought this was her nose. That's kind of cute. When Alan was 8, I convinced him he only had two weeks to live. But I suppose that tells you more about me than him. Yeah, good times. But back to recent events Remember when I told you the cat-litter box was filled with Almond Roca? He ate four of them. Are we done visiting Charlie Harper's Museum of Sibling Cruelty? I have something to talk about. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was interrupting you. Go ahead, Alan. Thank you. So as I was leaving my ex-wife's house I ran into your ex-husband. - Andy? - I guess. Wait a second. It's Mandi, Andy and Kandi? What's your point? No point. Mandi, Andy, Kandi. Dandy. Anyway, it appears as if Kandi has set my ex-wife up on a blind date with him. How nice. Nice? How is that nice? Well, he's been kind of depressed since we broke up. It's good to see he's getting back on the horse. But that horse is my ex-wife. Speaking of which, did you ever see The Bride and the Burro in Tijuana? See it? I caught the bouquet. So did Alan. Always a bridesmaid, never a burro. Charlie, I'm starting to lose feeling in my arm. Oh, I'm sorry. Hey, you went pretty far in the scouts. Can you undo this knot? Gee, actually, I specialized in Indian lore. Beaded belts, arrowheads. But, good luck though. Maybe you should go get a pair of scissors. Hang on, let me untie my feet. We really didn't think this through, did we? So has your mom been seeing a lot of Kandi's dad? That's right. If she married him, Kandi would be your stepsister. Hey, hey, hey, do you happen to know if they're going out tonight? Yep, if I married Kandi, she would be your stepmother. But But tonight Is your mom going out tonight? Yeah, yeah, I get it. If Kandi took a poop, it would be your step-stool. All right, well it's always good to talk to you. Love you, buddy. Did you get all that, Berta? I think so, but let's do a quick recap. Your girlfriend's living with your ex-wife. Your ex-wife's dating your girlfriend's father. To top it off, you're trying to get useful intelligence from a kid who's got precious little to spare. Okay, just checking. Hey, Berta. - I want you to meet Mandi. Mandi, Berta. - Hi. Listen we got a pair of scissors handy? Oh, Charlie, that's a silk tie. Why didn't you use one of the poly blends? Hey, hey, wait a minute, that's my tie. You ruined my tie. Oh, yeah. You're not gonna be happy about your electric toothbrush either. Kandi's told me so many nice things about you. How do you know Kandi? - She's my daughter. - Your daughter? Sweet whistling Geronimo. You people are like a box of hamsters, just crawling all over each other. Yes, yes. - We all get how this looks, Berta. - Hey, I'm not knocking it. I'm just wondering when some of that gravy's gonna spill over on my taters. Hey, what's up? What's up? What are you doing here? Well, Mandi came over to put in a good word for you and I figured I'd tag along for grins. Here comes one now. Come on in. I'm in a nightmare and I can't wake up. Sit down. Make yourself at home. Thanks I will. - Where's Where's Jake? - He's at a sleepover. Hi, Alan. How are you? About two heartbeats from a brain aneurysm. Where's Kandi? She's in her room. But I thought we should talk first. We just have a few questions. About what? Charlie? Well, Kandi's mom and I are a little concerned about your intentions. You should be because I intend to kill you. That's the kind of attitude that isn't gonna win you a lot of friends around here, mister. Alan, you're a very sweet man. But let's face facts. Kandi has her whole life ahead of her, while you not so much. - Kandi? - Alan? - I am so sorry. - No, I'm sorry. Oh, isn't that sweet? - I missed you so much. - I missed you too, huggy bear. Mom, I'm gonna go have sex with Alan, okay? You kids have fun. - Hold on there, young man. - What? Don't be a selfish lover. Consider her needs. This isn't over. You're right. He is easy to screw with. Hey, four pieces of Almond Roca. Even the cat was laughing at him. So should we head back to my place? I suppose. What's wrong? Nothing. It's just we've already had sex there. Oh, baby. I really, really like you. Well, thank you, Judith. I had a wonderful evening. I hope we can do it again some Maybe catch a movie. Or go for a hike. I'm guessing that's your ex-husband. - Good-looking man. - Oh, he's gorgeous. Dumb as wood. Oh, my Lord. But it's good wood. - I better find Alan so we can get out. - You wanna leave? This is so hot. Oh, Mandi, you just keep getting better and better. - Hang on while I give Alan a heads up. - Hurry back and give me one. Alan? Alan? You're the most beautiful man I've ever seen. Not Alan. Couldn't find him. Mandi. Mandi. You know what else I like? Swap meets. - Swell. - Yeah. Your ex-husband must be a real little guy, huh? Forget about him. Let's get some wine in you. Mandi. Glasses are in there. No, no, top shelf. That's what I'm talking about. Hey, you ever go rock climbing? It's a great workout. Mandi? Mandi. Alan? - Anybody? - Over here. Damn it. - What are you doing? - I was thirsty. - Have you seen Alan? - I've been in the closet. So where the hell is he? Oh, my, I'm sorry I'm so nervous. I haven't been with another woman in a long time. Yeah, yeah, take off your robe. Okay. Hot damn. Yeah, it is hot. - Hi, Daddy. - Hey, Judith. Daddy, I want you to meet my boyfriend, Alan. - Nice to see you again. - Small world. - I said I was sorry. - Just get out. I'll give you a call, Judith. Maybe we'll hit some garage sales. Yeah, terrific. I like your daughter. I like your ex-wife. Wanna get a drink? I'm not doing anything. Do you like garage sales? Where am I supposed to go? I don't care. Just leave. But I thought we were friends. Friends don't have sex with their friends' ex-husbands in the first friend's hot tub. Divorced three years and he's still ruining my life. Should have drowned his stupid ass. - Did you hear something? - Nope. - How's the head? - Let's find out. SDl Media Group   





                    			Alan, do you ever fantasize when we're making love? Well, occasionally I pretend that I'm better looking. What about you? Sometimes I imagine we're in the middle of a big department store. Having sex? No, shopping. Why would I fantasize about having sex while I'm having sex? Do you think about ham and cheese when you're eating a sandwich? Can't argue with that. What you thinking? Nothing really. I just I got a call from Jake's school today. You know who called me? Jessica Murray. Oh, who's that? A friend of mine. Yeah, well Anyway, Jake's mom and I have to go to a parent-teacher conference tomorrow and I don't really know what it's about. Hey, do you ever pretend your toes are little people? What? No. Sometimes I make believe they're different families playing Family Feud. All right, let's meet our champions. He goes to market, she stays home, please welcome the Piggy family. Hi, everybody. You' re going down Piggy family. You're going down. - Hey. - Hey. He's shooting 51 percent from beyond the arc. That's pretty good. How's it going? Forget it, Alan. I only do the aprs-sex chat with people I've just had sex with. Come on. She's playing Family Feud with her toes. I don't care if she's playing banjo with her nipples. I need to communicate after lovemaking. I need to share. You should have thought of that before boinking a girl with the IQ of Tickle Me Elmo. Fine. Hey, Berta. How's it going? Back off, zippy. You want pillow talk, you gotta spoon me first. I suppose I could talk about his grades again but I think we all agree that ship has pretty much sailed. So why did you wanna see us? Well, I'm concerned that even outside of the classroom Jake has no interest in anything that goes on around here. Now, hang on. He speaks very highly of your hot lunch program. Well, I was talking more about hobbies or extracurricular activities. Well, I don't know about his father but I've tried to share some of my interests with him. Unfortunately, he's a little young to drink in the dark and bitch about men. You know I was kind of lacking in focus when I was his age too till I got bit by the old theater bug. Too bad you didn't get bit by the old rabid squirrel. You know, I'm organizing a drama club. Would that be something Jake would have any interest in or do you think he gets enough drama at home? All the world's a stage. And we are merely players. Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble. She say what I'm in trouble for? Nope. Boy, it's the not knowing that drives you crazy. Yeah, like a pregnancy test. Yeah. I don't get it. Yes. In your face, Opie. This game stinks. No, you stink at it. That was my lunch money. Oh, your lunch money, why didn't you tell me? Boo-freaking-hoo. Pack a sandwich. Okay, Jake, well, we talked to Miss Sheffield. I'm sorry. - What are you sorry about? - I'm I'm sorry I interrupted you. Go ahead. It would be a good idea if you got involved in extracurricular activities. Oh, okay. Great, great. We'll talk about it at home. Do you know what an "extracurricular activity" is? Who cares? I'm off the hook. - What do you think? - What was this all about? - It's choreography. - It's gay. Okay. Forget about the movements. - Just try singing the song. - No. - Why not? - Because it's gay. Don't encourage him. Don't make him sing Gilbert and Sullivan. He needs something to audition for the school musical. You teach him a song. - Why don't you let him choose? - Jake. - Tell you uncle what you wanted to sing. - It's called "Whup That Stanky Ho. " All right. There's gotta be some middle ground here. - You like classic rock, right? - Yeah. Okay, well, pick a band. How about Queen? Oh, good. I was afraid he was gonna pick something gay. Doesn't sound right. You heard it too, huh? - You sure you played all the right notes? - Y es, I'm sure. It doesn't sound anything like Queen's version. No, it doesn't. Why don't you work on it. We'll try again tomorrow. Yeah, why don't I do that. The kid's a double threat: tone-deaf and arrogant. - Hey. - Where have you been? Kandi called for you. Oh, I had to work late. Yeah, one of my regular patients had a crisis. His name is Roger, he had a couple of vertebrae pinching a nerve. - T oo bad. - Nice guy, you'd like him. He restores old cars. Well, it's actually more a hobby than a job. He works at Staples. His name is Roger. - Alan. - Yeah? Why are you lying to me? I don't know. I really suck at it. You do indeed. Don't you care where I was? Why would I start now? Oh, come on, I really need to get this off my chest. All right, go ahead. - I was with another woman. - Okay, okay, see, that's a good lie. No, no. I really was with another woman. Seriously? You're already doing a hot 22-year-old and you're cheating on her? Yes. I am so proud of you. - What? - Who's the dog? My brother's the dog. Come on, dog. Come on, dog. Howl with me. No, stop howling and let me explain. There's nothing to explain. You're sleeping with two women at the same time. You're a big old dog. No, I haven't been sleeping with the other woman. I've been seeing Jake's teacher. All we do is talk. I don't know how to explain it. We have so much in common. I mean, she's divorced. She has a kid Jake's age. She reads. She likes the theater. Yeah, yeah. But you're not sleeping with her? - Why would I when I've got Kandi? - I don't know. Because you can? It's not that kind of a relationship. It's intellectual. So take her to a museum, enjoy the exhibits and do her in the restroom. - You're missing the point. - No, you're missing the point. Not getting laid, it's not cheating. - Then why do I feel so guilty? - That's easy. Because you're an idiot. I guess I always thought that one woman was supposed to fulfill all my needs. Oh, that's an old wives' tale. Started to protect the interests of, you guessed it, old wives. So you're saying the whole concept of monogamy is a fraud. - The institution of marriage is a sham? - No, no, no. I'm just saying, bang the teacher. Why does he make everything so complicated? Here we go. "Blunderbuss. " Very elegant use of my "under. " Thank you. Boy. I have more vowels than a Honolulu phone book. You're so clever, Alan. Thank you. You am smart too. - Hey, Alan, can I talk to you for a sec? - Sure. Excuse me. Hurry back. What's up? - You tell me. - Nothing, we're just playing Scrabble. And you're right. - There's nothing to feel guilty about. - Good to know. Because Kandi's here. Oh, okay. It's not a problem. Here's what we do. - We? - Come on, work with me. You go cover for me with Kandi and I'll get Francine the hell out of here. But there was nothing to feel guilty about. You know that and I know that, now go lie to Kandi about it. Fine, I'll tell her you went to Staples to see Roger. Who? - Hey, why don't we walk on the beach. - What about the game? Screw the game, I concede. You win, well-played. All right. It is a beautiful night. Yeah, yeah. Let's go enjoy it on the beach. Chop-chop. - Kandi? - What? Alan must have slipped out. - You're lying to me, Charlie. - No, I'm not. Oh, okay. Wait, wait. Don't you wanna know where he is? - Where who is? - Alan. Sure, why not. All right. The truth is Alan is out trying to find the perfect gift for you. - Really? - Yes. He wants to surprise you with something extremely expensive. Can you give me a hint? Well, let's see. It's something that's a girl's best friend and looks good wrapped around their neck. I'm getting a monkey? No, no. Sweet Lord. A diamond necklace. That's nice too. Just remember, you didn't hear it from me. Then who did I hear it from? Nobody. When he gives it to you, act surprised. Don't worry, I'll be really surprised. Good. Good. Good. So will he. That's That's That's terrific. - Do you wanna hear it again? - No. We don't want you to strain your voice. Do you think I'm gonna do okay at the audition? - You never know how these things go. - Yeah. Just hope I have a decent piano player. I thought you were working with him. What's the problem? Okay, there's a technical term we musicians use. Jake stinks. Well, is there anything we can do? We can hope "stinks" suddenly becomes popular. But I wouldn't count on it. Oh, by the way, you need to buy Kandi a diamond necklace. What? You told me to cover. I said you were out buying her jewelry. That's all you could think of? Well, I could think of a lot of things but only one made me laugh. I can't afford to buy her jewelry. I know. That's what makes it funny. Must have been so expensive. Yeah. You do realize this entitles you to extra-special bonus sex. What is extra-special bonus sex? It's whatever you want it to be. That sounds like fun. Go away. Okay, I'll just play Scrabble till you're ready. Give me a sec. Please don't tell me Francine is here. Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Francine is here? - Yeah, you want me to cover for you? - Yes. I'm on it. Wait. Charlie, I'm begging you. No more jewelry. Don't worry. It's not funny twice. Sorry, he must have gone out. Oh, okay. Tell him I stopped by. Francine, wait. I can't do this. Do what? I'm not a good liar. I know where he is, I'm just not supposed to tell you. The thing is, Alan does a lot of charity work. - Really? - Oh, yeah. Right now he's down at the nursing home giving sponge baths to old people. They don't go out a lot so they tend to get dusty. I had no idea. In fact, just the other night he was down on skid row teaching salsa dancing to crack addicts. Oh, my goodness. They have the energy, they just lack the focus. But I think I think what he's proudest of is his work with the kids. He takes runaways forced to live on the streets and teaches them how to live in the woods. I don't really see the point but those little urchins seem to thrive in the wild. It's like he's a saint. You must be so proud to have him as your brother. Well, truth be told, he does bring me a lot of joy. Thank you for telling me this, Charlie. You're welcome. Just promise you won't embarrass him bringing it up. Not a word. I just hope I can be worthy of him. And the plot moistens. Oh, that's terrific, buddy. I am so proud of you. Yeah, sure, I'll tell him. Oh, all right. Love you. Bye-bye. Guess what. Jake just got the lead in the school musical. The lead? What happened, did every other kid in school get mono? No, I think it was Francine. I think she cast Jake because of our relationship. You mean it's gotten physical? You're sleeping his way to the top? No, no. Nothing happened between us. - But I think she's fallen for me. - Really? What makes you think that? Well, I had lunch with her today and she was looking at me with I don't know worship in her eyes. Like I was some kind of - Saint? - Yes, yes. How did you know? That's how I think of you. Very funny. I've been doing my best not to lead her on but I guess I just underestimated my allure. Say that again. - What? - That last part. You mean, I underestimated my allure? Yeah, that's it. I'm sorry, am I missing something? No, not a thing. Well, good. You see, Alan. That's how you lie. Pretty exciting, huh? Opening night. Well, having seen the previews, I'm betting closing night too. Boy, this brings back memories. Sixth grade was the happiest two years of my life. It's the finger. Excuse me. So, Kandi, what's your favorite musical? The trombone. I can't believe you brought her here. I had to, Jake invited her. Is that a diamond necklace? You never gave me a diamond necklace. Y eah, well, you never gave me extra-special bonus sex. - Hi, Charlie. - Hi. - Who's this? - This? Oh, this is Kandi. Hi, I'm with Alan. Are you one of those young people he takes care of? Yep, yep, yep. Good old Saint Alan. Just can't do enough for the kids. Look at this diamond necklace he gave me. He gave you a diamond necklace? Don't get the wrong idea, it wasn't to get me to have sex. I was already doing everything he wanted. I am as shocked as you are. What was that about? Funny story. I'll tell you later.

                    			- Hey. - Hey. So, what's going on in school? Nothing. Nothing? You just sit there all day and stare at the wall? That's where the clock is. I got it. Well, I find it hard to believe that you just watch the clock all day. Have you seen my report card? Jake, it's for you. - I'm busy. - It's a girl. I don't care. Her name is Wendy Cho. Hold on, I'm coming. Don't hang up. Hey. How's it going? Okay, that's something we haven't seen before. Yeah, he only moves that fast when he's got the squirts. Wendy Cho is the smartest girl. I wonder why she's calling Jake. Maybe she lost a bet. Charlie, that's not nice. Well, kids are cruel. Jake is smitten with her. I hope he's not setting himself up for disappointment. Hey, you know what they say. A man's reach must exceed his grasp, or what's a penis for? Who says that? Okay, I might be paraphrasing. Okay, call you back. Bye. - Hey, Dad? - Yeah, Jake? Wendy Cho is having a party tomorrow night, can I go? T omorrow? A little last minute, isn't it? Well, she wasn't gonna invite me. Danny Palmer told Amy Sherlack I didn't like her. But I told Peter Calahan to tell Ellen Meisner that I kind of did. I see. You do? He lost me at Amy Sherlack. - Are her parents gonna be there? - I guess. Let the fathers who have girls worry about that. Shut up. All right, I'm gonna wanna meet her parents. I don't see any reason why you can't go. Cool. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna need a new shirt, new pants and new shoes. What's wrong with the clothes you've got? Are you kidding? Everybody's already seen them. Y eah, but not with all the latest food stains. I hear gravy's the new black. Fine, we'll go shopping tomorrow. How about a new haircut? What's wrong with my hair? Let's just say everybody's already seen it. Okay, a new haircut. So this is your first party with girls, huh? Maybe. Maybe? You're not sure? You got some cross-dressers in sixth grade? Playing a little pin the tail on the tranny? Shut up. Why does everyone keep telling me to shut up? Because you' re an insensitive dolt. That's no reason. This is a very delicate time in a boy's life. I remember how nervous I was about my first boy-girl party. Oh, right. That was in college, wasn't it? Shut up. What's important now is that we support Jake. Agreed. I'll kick in the wine coolers and condoms. What are you gonna do? You're joking, right? Okay, let's say I'm joking. I appreciate your interest, but this is a father-son moment. I've been looking forward to it since I saw the shadow of his little dingus in the first sonogram. That's very touching. And more than a bit creepy. But still, I can't risk letting you scar the kid forever. - What do you mean by that? - Face it, Alan. What can you bring to the table other than a lifetime of abject failure with women? It's not a lifetime yet. I, on the other hand, have a wealth of experience to offer. He's 12. He doesn't need to know how to choreograph a three-way. I'm not talking about that. I'm saving that for prom night. Oh, good. Let me give you an example. Jake's at the party. All the boys are on one side all the girls are on the other. What's he do? You see? You see? Right there. That "um" is the battle cry of the chronic masturbator. Define chronic. The solution to the problem, my hairy-palmed friend is to walk up to the prettiest girl and ask her to dance. Why the prettiest? She's the one all the other guys are afraid of. She'll be dying for some attention. What if Wendy Cho isn't the prettiest girl? It doesn't matter. When she sees our boy dancing with a hot chick, she'll be all over him. Of course, it's so obvious. Bet you're wishing you could do over sixth grade now, huh? - I could've danced with Heidi Winkler. - Yeah, you could've. - Or Pam Talega. - Yep. Or Mary Beth Hicks. Shoshana Wasserstein. I don't think so. Hey, can I get leather pants? - No. - No. Why not? Because you need something that lets the farts out. So Wendy Cho, huh? Real subtle, Alan. Charlie, it's a father-son thing. Yeah, so was pre-war Iraq. You wanna tell me about her? Not really. Is she in your class? Where else would I meet her? At a bar? - My turn? - No. I'm just curious about what kind of person she is. What it is about her that you find, I don't know, alluring. What? Your dad wants to know if you think she's hot. It's personal. She's hot. Are you nervous about this party? I don't know. Maybe a little. - Okay, here's what you do. - Charlie. Hey, hey, you had your shot. "Alluring. " - Is there gonna be dancing? - I think so. Terrific. Do you know how to dance? Not exactly. Don't worry, it's easy to fake. The thing to remember is the more you move your arms, the stupider you look. Oh, that is so not true. - Just keep it simple and you'll be fine. - Okay. Besides, the critical time is between dances. What do you mean? That's when you talk. More precisely, you get her to talk. - About what? - Doesn't matter. - You won't be listening anyway. - Oh, Charlie. Just drive the car. Yeah, Dad, this is important. Keep in mind, you're not looking to score. - You're getting into the batter's box. - Wendy doesn't like sports. You're missing the point. She plays violin. Listen to me. Your goal for the party tonight is to convince Wendy you're a mature, sophisticated guy who sees her not just as a woman but as a complete human. Got it? - I think so. - Good. I'm not going. Hey, hey, not only are you gonna go it'll be a night you'll remember for the rest of your life. That's what I'm afraid of. Oh, oh, this is nice. Yeah, sure, if he's doing the other kids' taxes. It's a timeless style. No, it just seems timeless when you're not getting laid. Put it back. This is cool. Yeah. Just one question. Is your Wendy Cho a voodoo priestess? No, I think she's Chinese. Put it back. There's something to be said for letting him make his own choices. Oh, that's a bunch of crap. He's an idiot. If we let him, he'd go to that party in a Viking helmet and a cape. Here we go. Don't even think about it. What? It says, "I've got a little money, but I'm not a corporate drone. " No, it says, "I'm pushing 40 and I can't deal with it. " All right, maybe the kid needs his own look. Jake, come here. - What? - Just stand there. Let's try and visualize what your personal style might be. Okay. Maybe we should start with the haircut. Oh, my, has Mommy been trimming your hair with her teeth? Not to worry, Ricky loves a challenge. I'm guessing Ricky also loves pretending he's a taffy apple. Wanna take him to your guy with the shaky hands and a signed picture of Desi Arnaz? Desi Arnaz had beautiful hair. So, Charles, do we have a game plan or shall I just follow my muse? - Can I get a Mohawk? - No. We should go for something young and hip. - Like your hairstyle? - Sure, why not? You'd have to kill me. Just tighten it up a little. Nothing extreme. - Can you make it purple? - No. Oh, man. Relax. Ricky knows what he's doing. He's been cutting my hair for years. What if I don't wanna look like you? - What's wrong with the way I look? - Nothing. If you're a statue in front of a Big Boy restaurant. - Are you freaking kidding me? - Charlie. - The kid should be so lucky. - We'll wait over here. I'm buying the little wise-ass a $75 haircut and he's taking shots at me? You said it, he has to find his own look. Yeah, let him find it on somebody else's MasterCard. - Look at his point of view. - What's his point of view? Well, put overalls on you and you do kind of look like the Big Boy. Stand like this for me. Shut up. By the way, did you have the talk with him? Oh, sure. I mean, well, we've had a talk. Covered the basics. He knows where babies come from. - How they got there. - That's all? He's going to this party clueless about how much fun he can have between "Hi" and "What do you mean, you missed your period? " It's a kids' party. Pizza, soft drinks, a little dancing. Oh, really? You know what I was doing at his age? - I don't wanna hear it. - You sure? It involves Shoshana Wasserstein. You danced with Shoshana Wasserstein? Actually, that's one thing we didn't do. Nevertheless, I'm Jake's father. I believe childhood should be a time of innocence. I agree. Childhood should be a time of innocence. And Bambi's mother shouldn't die. Lap dances should be complimentary after the fifth cocktail. But that's not the world we live in. This party tonight is the initial round in a lifelong process of sexual elimination. - Oh, really? - Think of it as musical chairs. But when the music stops, the guys who have a clue are sitting on a woman instead of a chair. The guys who have no clue, they'll spend their teenage years Well, I certainly don't need to tell Dungeon Master Alan. Come on, Jake, we're gonna be late for the party. I'm ready. - It's very nice. - Yeah, I think we're good. Turn around. You're supposed to take the price tag off. But you said it was good to be seen in expensive clothes. You still want him to learn from his mistakes? Fine. Can we go now? Hang on. Let's see the dance moves. Don't stare at your shoes, eyes on the girl at all times. Pretend you care. Good. Good. Good. Now how do you stand when you know Wendy's looking at you? That's it. A little head bob. Show me the sleepy eyes. I said sleepy, not brain-dead. All right. - Who's the man? Who's the man? - I'm the man. I'm the man. Okay, let's go get them. - Alan. - I'm coming. 2136 Try the house with the balloons tied to the mailbox. Oh, right. Okay, let's go. Where are you going? I wanna meet her parents, say hello, find out when to pick you up. Alan, you take one step out this car I will beat your brains out with a tire iron. Thank you, Uncle Charlie. Have fun. Call my cell when you want me to pick you Up. There he goes. My son is attending his first boy-girl party. Who's that opening the door? Oh, oh, that's Wendy Cho. Oh, good, she's cute. The kid's got taste. But she's like a foot taller than him. That's all right. When they slow dance, his head will be perfectly positioned. Oh, get your mind out of the gutter. Right, like you never copped a feel with your ear? No. Okay, once with Aunt Sophie. But that was an accident. You know what I'm talking about. Oh, yeah. Here you go. Thank you. Oh, looks good. She's pretty, huh? Yeah, I guess. What's the matter with you? What if I sent him out there too soon? What if he's not ready? Don't beat yourself, you did everything you could. There just wasn't enough time, damn it. It's out of our hands. We let nature take its course. Sounds good, unfortunately nature keeps telling him to scratch his ass. - It's Jake. - God, I knew it. Give me that. No, no, no, I got it. Hey, what's up, buddy? He wants to come home. Why? He just got there. Why? You just got there. He says it's personal. Give me that. Jake, Jake, I'm gonna talk you through this. Just pipe down and listen. Finish your cookie later. Where's Wendy Cho right now? How many girls is she talking to? Okay, okay, you gotta split her from the herd. Walk over and say you have something to ask her. Then take her hand and lead her away from her friends. Okay, then put the cookie down first. Now, when you have some privacy, I want you to look her in the eye and say you were lying. You just wanted to be alone with her. It will too work. All right, call me back. God, I just wish I could be there with him. - Me too. - Thanks. Ready for a refill? Sure. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just worried about my nephew. He's at his first boy-girl party. Oh, that's adorable. He's my son. - How old is he? - Twelve. Kid's the apple of my eye. You're so sweet. Excuse me, officially, it's my apple and my eye. Okay. Connie. - Charlie. - Would you like some pie, Charlie? It's on the house. Your house or mine? You're awful. Mine. Un-freaking-believable. Look, Connie, I'm kind of tied up tonight with my nephew. Why not write your number on the bill? Already did. What? - He's my son. - But I know how to use him. Oh, it's Jake. Talk to me. No, you're the man. You're the man. Great. Keep me posted. Who's the man? Right. What? What? It's going well. He's gonna be one of the last to leave. That's a good sign. Yeah. You tend to lose track of time when you're in a closet with a girl. I just wish I could've covered kissing with him. Please, God, don't let him pucker. - What's wrong? - Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry, Wendy will know what to do. She's probably been practicing with her girlfriends. Man, chicks are so lucky. It's not the kissing. It's this whole thing. I'm sorry if I interfered with the father-son deal, but No, no, no, you've done a great job. Jake's really lucky to have you. So, what's the problem? I guess I'm a little jealous. - Of what? - Charlie do you have any idea what it would've meant to have you take me under your wing the way you have with Jake? Oh, here we go. Dad was gone, there was no one to teach me. You know how I found out about French kissing? Mom sliced a plum in half and stuck her tongue in it. You could have taken that secret to the grave. And that's not all she showed me. T o this day, I can't eat plums, dried apricots or bananas. All right, all right, I'm sorry. Look, I was young, I was selfish, I should have been there for you. You know, it's not too late. That's a real nice idea, buddy. But I'm afraid it is. - Hey. - Hey. Well, how'd it go? Okay. - Just okay? - Alan, leave it alone. All right. - So, Jake, congratulations. - For what? You got lipstick all over your mouth. Oh, man. Relax, I was bluffing. But congratulations. Thanks. Well, it was touch-and-go there for a while. But I think Jake's off to a good start with the ladies. Yeah, listen, Charlie. Don't take this the wrong way but I really don't want Jake to grow up like you. Alan, how could I possibly take that the wrong way? No, I mean, I don't want him to be a player. I want him to value women and cherish his relationships with them. Hey, I value women, I cherish my relationships with them. But I take your point. Hey, Dad, how old do you have to be to get married? I guess 18. Why? Just wondering how long Wendy and I have to wait. One kiss and he's ready to marry the girl. So? So you don't have to worry. He's definitely your son. SDl Media Group   





                    			- Morning. - Morning. Yeah, what's up? Oh, stop it. - Hey. Give me back my skully. - This is not a skully. It's a ski cap your grandmother gave you for Christmas. - Charlie, he's just trying to find his look. - Word. Word? There's a reindeer on it. Don't listen to him, Jake. I think it looks very dope on you. Oh, man. Oh, hey, did you see that your former girlfriend's dance troupe is in town? Mia's here? Let me see that. Come on, come on, come on. Whoa, is somebody still carrying a torch? T orch? Don't be ridiculous. I mean, I'm glad to see she's following her dream but I've moved on. - I think she called the other day. - What? When? What did she want? What did she say? Come on, kid, spill it. Nope, no unresolved feelings there. She wanted to talk to you but you weren't home. I know that, you chowderhead. What else did she say? She said, "What's new? " I said, "Nothing much. " And then she said, "How's school? " I said, "It sucks. " Then she said, "That's too bad. " I said, "Yeah. " I'm gonna kill him, Alan. I swear to God I'm gonna kill him. Oh, yeah, she wants us to come see her dance next weekend. It says she's performing this weekend. Oh, I guess she called last weekend. - You're telling me this now? - Charlie. Calm down. How many things does the kid have to handle? Eat, poop, tell me who called. She said some guy named Will has tickets. - Who's Will? - I don't know. She said he'd call. Will's gonna call? - You mean the tickets are at will call? - I don't know. Maybe. Dear God, he's a doorstop that eats. Do me a favor. From now on, when somebody calls, write it down. - I did. - Where? - On my homework. - Okay, where's your homework? Oh yeah, my teacher called. She wants to meet with you. When? Oh, I guess it was last week. Peace out. Great. Great. Thank you. Mia left us four seats for Friday night. House seats, center orchestra. What do you think? You, me, Jake, Kandi, go out to dinner, make an evening of it? Sounds like fun. Maybe afterwards you could tie me to an anthill, and smear honey on my genitals. So you don't wanna go? Jeez, now I see where the kid gets his brains. No, I don't wanna go. Why would I wanna go? Because you were in love with the woman and still have feelings for her and wanna see her. Oh, that's crazy. God, you are so naive. - How am I naive? - Oh, oh, I know this one. Alan, when an ex-girlfriend calls, no good can come from it. Unless, you know, it's 2 a. m., she's blind drunk and wants to get even with her new cheating boyfriend. She just wanted to invite us to the ballet. Yeah, right. And girls are completely unaware that you can see their nipples through their shirts. What does that have to? Really, they know? There's only a few reasons why an ex calls. One, they're great, and wanna rub your nose in it. Or two, they're doing lousy and need to borrow money. Three, they got money from knocking over a Laundromat and wanna hide it under your trailer until the heat's off. It happens. Okay, okay, how about four? She misses you, and wants to try again? What is it she's gonna try? T o change me into something I'm not? T o get me to stop drinking, smoking, gambling? To rescue me from the barren, loveless abyss my life has become? What? You know what I think? You were never happier than when you were with Mia. You still have feelings for her. You're afraid to admit it. You are so wrong. You couldn't be more wrong. - You believe that guy? - You want the truth? - No, probably not. - Good call. Oh, by the way, here's the 20 bucks I owe you. I am telling you, it is not appropriate to wear to the ballet. Why you tripping on me? Hey, Alan. Matey. - I'm not a pirate. - You're not a gangsta either. You're a dorky, white kid with a Cub Scout bandana on his head. Yo, hate the game, don't hate the player. You know kids better than me. How long does this pimp stage last? Just ignore him. - You sure you won't come with us? - Positive. - Should I at least say hi to Mia for you? - Say what you want. - I'm meeting somebody at Pavlov's. - Who? How would I know? I haven't met her yet. Hi. Do I look okay? - Perfect. - Hey, no fair. You grow a rack like that, you can wear anything you want on your head. You have a house on the beach? I'd love to see it. - I could take you there. - Great. Then I could bring you out on my deck. We could watch the surf in the moonlight. Then I could take you in my arms, kiss you. Not a big kiss. Just a little something that gives you a taste of what's to come. Well, let's go. I'd take your hand and lead you up to my bedroom where I'd slowly undress you. Then lay you down on the crisp, cool sheets and make wild, passionate love to you until we're both totally spent. Okay. Then in the morning, I'll bring you a cup of coffee and your car keys. Wait, my car keys? I'll promise to call you but I never will. And when you call me, you'll find that the phone number I gave you belongs to a dry cleaner in Koreatown. What? When all is said and done, you know what we'll both have? Nothing. Not even a good memory. What do you say we do us both a favor and not go through with this charade? Okay. Jeez, I was just trying to get laid. See, Jake, the swan is dying. Can you believe? Excuse me. Pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hey. - What did I miss? - I thought you weren't coming. I'm not here for Mia. I'm here to support the arts. Yikes, look at the package on that pretty dude. Hey, good job. Eat something. - Charlie. - Hey. You were terrific. Thank you. - I'm so glad you came. - Are you kidding me? I've been looking forward to this all week. - Dressed like that? - Well, how else would you recognize me? - These are for you. - Thank you. They're beautiful. No big deal, they had them at the liquor store. It was either this or a stack of lotto scratchers. - I think you made the wise choice. - We'll never know, will we? Alan would've come, but he had to take the kids home. - Kids? - He's kind of adopted a young girl. - Really? - Well, not so much adopted as banging. So you're looking good. - You too. How have you been? - Great. Just great. Really great. - Good. - No, no. No, great. - And you, how have you been? - Wonderful. All right then, I'm great and you're wonderful. So what the hell are we doing here? There was something I wanted to talk to you about. - Hey, Mia. Who's your cute friend? - This is Charlie. Charlie, Theresa. Hey. So, what did you want to talk to me about? This really isn't the right place. Why don't I get changed and stop by your house? Sure. I'll be up. - Because, you know, I'm a night person. - I remember. Of course, if you come too late, I could be drunk. - I remember. - There could be other women there. I remember. - See you later. - Whatever. Hey, can you unhook me? What's going on? Nothing. Mia's coming over, so I thought I'd Nothing. - I see. - What do you mean you see? You're right. It's too much. - How's that? - Well, I Right. She'll smell there were candles burning, so I have to light at least one. - What about the music? - What about it? You're right. Sounds like I'm trying too hard. - Better? - Well, I You're right. No music. - Charlie? - Yeah? I'm just glad you're over her. Get the door. Get the door. Get the door. - Hi, Alan. - Hey, Mia, you were great tonight. - Thanks. Did Jake like it? - He was absolutely knocked out. Charlie, Mia's here. Oh, really? - Well, ask her in. - All right. - Won't you come in? - Okay. Hi, Mia, I almost forgot you were coming. Get out. - Nice to see you again. - Nice to see you too. Sit down, make yourself at home. Place looks the same. Well, you know me, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. If it is broke, who gives a rat's ass? - Can I get you a drink? - No, I'm good. - So am I. In fact, I'm great. - Yeah, you mentioned that. Repeatedly. So, what did you wanna talk about? Oh, boy. This is a hard thing to ask. You need some money. What? No. So, what? You wanna get back together again? Oh, God no. All right, then, how about a quickie for old times' sake? Please. Charlie I think you're a terrific guy. You're smart, you're handsome, you're talented. All good arguments for the quickie. - Will you let me finish? - Didn't I always? Sorry. Sorry, go on. I've been thinking a lot lately about what I want out of life. I love dancing, but let's face it, I'm not getting any younger. So the time has come for me to make some tough choices. - I understand completely. - You do? No, I'm just trying to be supportive. Charlie, I came here because Well I want your sperm. All right, where do you want it? - Alan, Alan, wake up. Wake up. - What? Mia wants sperm. Well, don't look at me. No, no, she wants my sperm. She wants me to make a deposit so she can have a baby. - You're kidding. - Apparently, that's another of its uses. What the hell is that? I'm not sure. Near as I can tell, she's chasing a rabbit. So why did Mia come to you? Well, it turns out her biological clock is ticking. Most of the guys she meets are ballet dancers, so, slim pickings there. She doesn't wanna wait for Mr. Right to come along. - Which pretty much leaves you. - Yep. I'm good genetic material, you know, easy on the eyes. And she wants to raise the kid alone which fits nicely into my lifestyle. Charlie, drinking, gambling and casual sex is not a lifestyle. Okay, okay, I didn't come in here to argue with you. Look in the hedges, look in the hedges. What? I don't know. So, what are you gonna do? You gonna go to a sperm bank? Well, I tried to talk her into a direct deposit. You know, straight from the tap. But she really dug in her heels. And not in the good way. - And you're okay with it? - Well, why not? I've sent billions of soldiers out there. It's time for one of them to finally take the hill. - Now what? - I think she caught the rabbit. Anyway, I'm thinking this could be my one chance to guarantee that the Charlie gene lives on. You know, make sure the double helix that is uniquely me keeps on trucking into the future. Okay, let's assume that's a good thing. - One more question. - Yeah? If you have no doubts, why'd you wake me up to tell me? Well, you're my brother and I thought you should know you're gonna be an uncle. You mean, I'm gonna be an uncle to a child I'll never see. Tell you what, when he turns 12, I'll track him down bring him to live with you and we'll see if you get your phone messages. - What do you think? - Looks like pretty standard boilerplate. It says that once your swim team's off the bus, you're no longer the coach. All right. Let's see, where do I sign? The old John Hancock, if you will. You sure you want to? You're giving up the rights not only to your sperm but to any children that might result from them. It. - I understand. - Do you? Once you sign, Mia can do whatever she wants with it. Them. She can use it, resell it, freeze it, put it on eBay. Hey, I don't care if she uses it to caulk her bathtub. Once the boys reach escape velocity, they're on their own. - I see. - It's out of my hands, so to speak. I got it. Okay. I'll be back in two shakes. Three, if it's cold in there. Charlie? You okay? - Charlie? - What? You've been in there a long time. How's it going? How do you think it's going? Well, I don't know if this'll help, but sometimes when I was married I used to pretend I was having sex with a completely different woman. Oh, thanks. The image of you bumping uglies with your ex-wife should really move things along. Excuse me, I was just trying to help. Yeah, well, I was just trying to have sex with a cup. Don't think of it as a cup. Think of it as a polyurethane lapdancer. - Get out. - I'm going. - Hello? - Charlie, I was just getting packed. Oh, right, you're heading to San Francisco. That's gotta be a big ballet town. Yeah. So did you go to the sperm bank? And? Not a lot of laughs in that place. I asked the receptionist if she takes work home with her. Nothing. Not even a smile. Thanks for doing this. You have no idea what it means to me. Yeah, well, funny thing, turns out it means something to me too. - What are you talking about? - I tried, Mia, I really did. I tried the magazines, the movies. You can't imagine how bad porn acting is until you actually watch more than three, four minutes at a time. So you're saying you couldn't? You? Yeah, I know. What are the odds? Well, I guess these things happen. You'll try again. I'm sure you'll do fine. I don't think so. Why not? I have thoughts about the reason things didn't go down as planned, or actually, up. Okay, I'm listening. As I was sitting in that little sperm cubicle watching Assmasters 7: The Final Chapter all I could think about was some kid of mine growing up somewhere and me not having a chance to, you know, be a part of his life. - I thought you were okay with that. - I thought I was too. But as it turns out, I'm not. So if this is something you really wanna do then you're gonna have to find someone else. I see. And by the way, Assmasters 7 is not the final chapter. They left a lot of loose ends. All right, well, I gotta go. - I appreciate the effort. - Oh, thanks. I think I have a rotator cuff injury. Good seeing you again, Charlie. Good seeing you too. - Hey, let me float another idea by you. - What? It's a little crazy, a little unorthodox. If you really want a kid, this could be the solution. - Charlie, I am not having sex with you. - Who said anything about having sex? I'm asking you to marry me. There's no Charlie here. Why you stupid girls keep calling? No, listen, I don't take message. I do dry cleaning. One more time, there's no Charlie here. SDl Media Group   





                    			Hello? Anybody? Big news. I'm gonna marry Mia. Hey, Alan. I'm in the shower. Guess what I'm gonna do with Mia. Guess what I'm already doing with Kandi. That's not fair, Alan. You have to give him a hint. He doesn't need a hint. Well, then how's he supposed to guess? Oh, well. Look, a place to hang my washcloth. The rule of thumb with an engagement ring is that the price should equal three months' salary. I wonder what broad came up with that. It's a marketing scheme dreamed up by the international diamond cartel. Probably a bunch of chicks. But at least diamonds are forever. Oh, yeah, forever. My ex-wife still has hers. Meanwhile, I'm wearing mismatched socks from the irregular bin. Well, Mia and I are gonna go the distance. Fifteen, maybe 20 years. That's not the distance. The distance is death. If I'm still married after 20 years, kill me. - I can't believe you're doing this at all. - Why not? Why shouldn't someone like me settle down with a wife and kids? Boy, I don't know where to start. That's the old Charlie you're thinking of. Oh, okay. And to whom am I speaking now? - May I help you gentlemen? - We're looking for an engagement ring. How nice. Do you have anything in mind? Nothing ostentatious. Something in a brilliant cut, perhaps with complementary baguettes. Size isn't as important as color and clarity. Well, someone knows what he wants. What can I say? He's my life. So basically I asked her to marry me and she said yes. - What do you think about that, Jake? - Good. That's it? Good? It's not good? No, it's good. That's what I said. All right, I'm full. Wears his little heart on his sleeve, doesn't he? It's my own fault. I should've known better than to talk to him at feeding time. Charlie, I need to speak to you. I'll be right out, Rose. - Did you tell her? - Of course not. - Would you? - No. - I'll let you be my best man. - You mean I'm not? Well, you're on the short list but this could cinch it. Come on, that woman has been obsessed with you for years. She's gonna find out sooner or later. Let it come from you. Yeah, I guess. She has a boyfriend now. She probably won't care. - Probably not. - So why won't you tell her? Because if I want my eyebrows shaved, I'll shave them myself. Hey, Rosey Rose. What's up, Rosey Rose? Gordon dumped me. Oh, damn it to hell. I know, it's awful. How could he do this? He couldn't be with me anymore knowing that I'm still in love with you. Oh, no, no, no. Yes, yes, yes yes, yes. Listen, Rose. - There's something I have to tell you. - Is it good news? I could use some good news. Well -  you remember Mia? - Yeah. Don't tell me you're dating her again. No, no. No, we are not dating. Good. Because I always thought she was kind of a head case. Yeah. Look, the thing is, I'm gonna, kind of, marry her. Rose? - Did you hear me? - I heard you. You're gonna marry Mia. So are you okay? Sure. Why wouldn't I be okay? Well, I was afraid the news might come as a bit of a shock to you. Afraid? There's nothing to be afraid of, Charlie. You're my friend. Where are you going? I have things to do. - What kind of things? - Things. Goodbye, Charlie. Hello, Alan. Hello. Did she just use the front door? She's never used the front door before. What happened out there? Well, I told her I was gonna marry Mia and I think I could actually see her medication stop working. - What do you think she's gonna do? - The question isn't what, it's when. And how I'm gonna enjoy my honeymoon with my testicles glued to my ass-crack. - That's a pretty wedding gown. - Oh, yeah. I could crawl under there during the reception and no one would have a clue. Well, you would. Stop. I don't think you'd say that. Isn't it beautiful? They say you're supposed to spend three months' salary but I went four. - Because I'm worth it? - No, actually I had a slow first quarter. My dad called today. He wants to take your family out for dinner. Y eah, well, tell him he can have one or the other but not both. Come on, they're gonna have to meet sooner or later. Okay, but why don't we wait for a real happy occasion? - What's happier than a wedding? - My mother's funeral springs to mind. There'll be music, dancing, my mom will be in a box. You're horrible. That's a gorgeous wedding cake. It's okay. I'm not big on having the little action figures on top. - They kind of creep me out. - They're traditional. Hey, this is our wedding, we can do whatever we want. We don't even have to have cake, we could have pie. A wedding pie? Well, we'd probably need more than one. You know, so everybody gets some crust. Alan, what do you think about a wedding with no cake? No cake? Where would you put the little bride and groom? I can think of one place. - If you do a wedding, do it right. - Thank you, Alan. You're welcome. Which reminds me, I found my wedding folder. - Guess what was in it? - The claim check for your manhood? As I was saying it's all here. Everything you could possibly need for your big day. From paper samples for your announcements to selected verses of poetry well-suited for wedding vows. And you wonder why people think you're gay. Oh, shush. Now, you're talking cake but we are light years away from cake. First we have to discuss the budget, the venue, how many guests. Is it gonna be a sit-down dinner or a buffet. Then you need to hire a photographer and a videographer. Then a florist. Have you thought about flowers? Well, lilies are nice. Lilies are perfect if the bride and groom are recently deceased. But I like lilies. Mia, we'll never get through this if you don't focus. Now, wedding party. Bridesmaids. What are they wearing? I suggest an unflattering style in a hideous color because after all, this is your day. Oh, and before I forget, although it's not politically correct to throw rice if you throw birdseed, you run the risk of ending like a Hitchcock movie. What kind of pie did you have in mind? Well, look who's here. The bride of Drunkenstein. Look. Wow, that's quite a rock. You know what we call babes with rings like that in my neighborhood? Stumpy. What are you looking at me for? Just stay out of her neighborhood. That was uncomfortable. No, sand in my urethra is uncomfortable. That meal was a freaking disaster. I'm gonna stay with my family, try and calm my mother down. The miserable bitch. - Your family hates me, don't they? - Not just you. I'll call you later. Do you believe your future mother-in-law? Shows up at a four-star restaurant wearing a tracksuit with the word "juicy" stretched across her half-acre ass. I can read, Mom. Can we go back? I forgot my doggy bag. We can never go back, Jake. Come on, it's not the end of the world. Easy for you to say. You're not marrying into the Addams family. Oh, like you were a prize. Slipping a prenuptial agreement into my fiance's menu. I am just trying to protect you from being wiped out by a vindictive ex-wife who will use your hard-earned money to finance a frivolous life of partying and shopping and unnecessary plastic surgery. - Mom - Every one of my surgeries was necessary. And if I had signed a pre-nup you would never have gone to music camp and Alan would have an overbite you could use to open a can of Pennzoil. I didn't know Mia's last name was Addams. I didn't know her sister is a cop. Was a cop. Now she's a dry drunk with a grudge and a. 38. Well, I liked her. Well, that's because she had the same haircut as you. I was a little shocked that her father stuck you with the bill. You know why you noticed that? Because the two of you trampled each other trying to get to the men's room when you saw the waiter bringing it. I drank a lot of iced tea. Well, I had a very nice time. Sure, you got to inform my bride-to-be and her entire family that you had sex with me before you had sex with him. I was just telling Mia I know how lucky she is. Nevertheless, honey, it was not an appropriate toast. Juicy-pants almost choked to death on her lamb shank. Well, in all fairness, the woman was stuffing her face like a musket. All I can say is, after tonight's fiasco I'm gonna have to rethink the seating chart for the wedding. Yeah, well, it won't be that complicated. - Why not? - Because none of you are invited. Well, Mom, if you wear an animal print tracksuit to a nice restaurant people are gonna make comments. I agree. Calling you a cougar with arm fat was over the line. Hang on. Hello, Mia. I'll call you back. You don't think Mia's gonna turn into her mother, do you? I wouldn't worry about it. Yeah. What I would worry about is you turning her into our mother. Thanks for ruining my wedding night, Dr. Freud. Hey, don't set the bar too high for the wedding night. - What are you talking about? - It's a long, stressful day. You'll be exhausted, full of banquet food and cheap champagne. Take my advice. Tell her you love her, give her a big kiss and try to fall asleep with your ass pointed toward an open window. You, sir, have the heart of a poet. I am merely the voice of smelly experience. Well then, let me ask you this. I know things didn't end well with you and Judith but overall, did you like being married? Oh, I loved being married. Never missed having sex with other women? Sure. But I missed that before I got married too. What I loved was the idea of having someone that I could always turn to. Someone who cared about me. Someone who'd always stand by me through thick and thin. It does sound nice. Yeah, so does Disneyland. Yet every day people stagger off those giant teacups covered in vomit. But you'd do it again? What can I say? Marriage is a great ride until you puke. - Good night. - Good night. Charlie. Mia? Your friend Rose was just at my apartment. So how'd that go? She was wearing a bridal gown. Planning on wearing it to our wedding. She wanted me to know so we wouldn't clash. Well, that's kind of thoughtful, isn't it? I'm not finished. She wanted to give me a shower. An engagement shower? An actual soap and water shower. I don't want her at my wedding. Hey, I don't want her in my zip code. But she's a close friend. - Charlie. - All right, all right, I'll tell you what I'll cross Rose off the guest list if you dump that pistol-packing hermaphrodite you call a sister. She's my maid of honor the gun is registered, and she's taking hormones. While we're pruning, what about your mother? Done. She's out. Now your mother. You would've thrown your mother overboard for free. I don't care. If she goes somebody on your side's gotta go. How about your father? He takes us all out to dinner and the only plastic he's got on him is his shoes. Charlie, he has to give me away at the wedding. Give you away? That cheapskate? I'll probably have to trade him a pony and a couple of blankets for you. We're gonna have a wedding that none of our family and friends can attend? Might as well go to Vegas and elope. Now, there's an interesting concept. In Vegas, not only could we get married immediately we can get drunk and gamble away our nest egg. Don't forget the lap dances and hookers. Oh, you're gonna make a great wife. All the wonderful plans I had for a wedding. Let it go, Alan. I don't understand the big rush. You wouldn't even stop for boutonnieres. I just wanna get this over with. Get this over with? That's the attitude you take to a proctologist, not a marriage. Well, maybe I'm a little nervous. - Is that all it is? - What are you saying? I'm saying that if you're feeling uneasy, maybe you're not ready for this. - Did you have doubts when you married? - None. Judith assured me I was doing the right thing. That's all I got. Hi. - You look beautiful. - Thanks. I was afraid you were gonna chicken out. That's funny, she said the same thing about you. Thank you, Kandi. Are you sure this is what you wanna do? I'm sure. Are you? Absolutely. Okay. Who's the lucky couple? Well, we're the ones getting married, so I guess it's them. - Charlie. - A joke. Alrighty. Now, before we begin the ceremony I need both your signatures there and there. Okay. So are you folks staying in Vegas or are you honeymooning somewhere else? I don't know. What do you think, sweetie? Oh, can I talk to you for a second? What'd I say? Am I in trouble already? Baby, I swear to God, I think we're the lucky couple. Relax, I just want to talk to you about our honeymoon. I'll take you anywhere you wanna go. Frankly, I'd pick a place with a nice ceiling because we're just gonna take turns looking at it. Charlie, I would love to honeymoon with you. But, well, I have to work and I think it'd be smarter to use the money to redo the house. Oh, I get it. You gave up trying to change me so now the house has to suffer? If we're gonna have a family, we'll turn the second bedroom -  into a nursery. - But that's where Jake stays. But once Alan moves out then Jake won't be staying there anymore, right? - Alan's moving out? - Of course he is. Isn't he? This is so romantic. When I was a little girl, I used to love playing bride. Me too. I mean, I was the groom. Most of the time. You think you'll ever get married again? I don't know. I hope so. You should because you'd make a good husband. You're kind, considerate, dependable and you're cuter than a duck wearing a hat. Oh, come on, Charlie, we need our privacy. But they're my family. I can't just kick them out. You could've said something before now. Who knew your idea of marriage was you and me alone in a house? As long as I've known you, you've been complaining about Alan living with you. And you want to take that away from me? I thought you were ready to grow up but clearly I was wrong. What's more grown up than wanting to take care of my family? Let's not forget, you're the one who came back to me. I only came back because I wanted your sperm. Yeah, well, it's a package deal. My sperm and my brother go hand in hand. Kandi, this is so sudden. I know. But lots of good things are sudden. Like sun showers, orgasms. That's two things. Multiple orgasms. That's five. All right, deal's off. Let's get out of here. Hang on. Are you really serious about this? You love me, I love you, the sex is great. The sex is unbelievable. Wait, what'd you say? I said the wedding's off. Oh, my God, what happened? It doesn't matter. What's important is I just avoided making a huge mistake. Charlie, I am so sorry. Oh, thanks. Now let's head for a strip joint, get drunk and let the healing begin. Yeah, but before we do that, I was wondering -  could I ask you for a little favor. - Yeah? - Can I borrow your wedding ring? - What for? Well, I thought as long as we're in Vegas, I'd marry Kandi. Are you insane? Oh, come on, you're not using it. By the powers vested in me by the state of Nevada I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. I don't freaking believe it. Cheer up, Charlie. You're finally getting what you always wanted. I'm moving out of your house. I don't freaking believe it. SDl Media Group
